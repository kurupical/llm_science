      "Anomeric effect[SEP]In organic chemistry, the anomeric effect or Edward-Lemieux effect is a stereoelectronic effect that describes the tendency of heteroatomic substituents adjacent to a heteroatom within a cyclohexane ring to prefer the axial orientation instead of the less hindered equatorial orientation that would be expected from steric considerations. This effect was originally observed in pyranose rings by J. T. Edward in 1955 when studying carbohydrate chemistry. The term anomeric effect was introduced in 1958. The name comes from the term used to designate the lowest-numbered ring carbon of a pyranose, the anomeric carbon. Isomers that differ only in the configuration at the anomeric carbon are called anomers. The anomers of D-glucopyranose are diastereomers, with the beta anomer having an OH group pointing up equatorially, and the alpha anomer having that OH group pointing down axially. The anomeric effect can also be generalized to any cyclohexyl or linear system with the general formula C-Y-C-X, where Y is a heteroatom with one or more lone pairs, and X is an electronegative atom or group. The magnitude of the anomeric effect is estimated at about 1–2 kcal/mol in the case of sugars, but is different for every molecule. center|377px In the above case, the methoxy group on the cyclohexane ring (top) prefers the equatorial position. However, in the tetrahydropyran ring (bottom), the methoxy group prefers the axial position. This is because in the cyclohexane ring, Y= carbon, which is not a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect is not observed and sterics dominates the observed substituent position. In the tetrahydropyran ring, Y= oxygen, which is a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect contributes and stabilizes the observed substituent position. In both cases, X= OMe. The anomeric effect is most often observed when Y= oxygen, but can also be seen with other lone pair bearing heteroatoms in the ring, such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The exact method by which the anomeric effect causes stabilization is a point of controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain it. ==Physical explanation and controversy== The physical reason for the anomeric effect is not completely understood. Several, in part conflicting, explanations have been offered and the topic is still not settled. ===Hyperconjugation=== ====Cyclic molecules==== A widely accepted explanation is that there is a stabilizing interaction (hyperconjugation) between the unshared electron pair on the endocyclic heteroatom (within the sugar ring) and the σ* orbital of the axial (exocyclic) C–X bond. This causes the molecule to align the donating lone pair of electrons antiperiplanar (180°) to the exocyclic C-X σ bond, lowering the overall energy of the system and causing more stability. center|377px Some authors also question the validity of this hyperconjugation model based on results from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. While most studies on the anomeric effects have been theoretical in nature, the n–σ* (hyperconjugation) hypothesis has also been extensively criticized on the basis that the electron density redistribution in acetals proposed by this hypothesis is not congruent with the known experimental chemistry of acetals and, in particular, the chemistry of monosaccharides. ====Acyclic molecules==== Hyperconjugation is also found in acyclic molecules containing heteroatoms, another form of the anomeric effect. If a molecule has an atom with a lone pair of electrons and the adjacent atom is able to accept electrons into the σ* orbital, hyperconjugation occurs, stabilizing the molecule. This forms a \"no bond\" resonance form. For this orbital overlap to occur, the trans, trans conformation is preferred for most heteroatoms, however for the stabilization to occur in dimethoxymethane, the gauche, gauche conformation is about 3–5 kcal/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the trans,trans conformation—this is about two times as big as the effect in sugars because there are two rotatable bonds (hence it is trans around both bonds or gauche around both) that are affected. center|377px ===Dipole minimization=== Another accepted explanation for the anomeric effect is the equatorial configuration has the dipoles involving both heteroatoms partially aligned, and therefore repelling each other. By contrast the axial configuration has these dipoles roughly opposing, thus representing a more stable and lower energy state. center|434px Both the hyperconjugation and the dipole minimization contribute to the preferred (Z)-conformation of esters over the (E)-conformation. In the (Z) conformation the lone pair of electrons in the alpha oxygen can donate into the neighboring σ* C-O orbital. In addition, the dipole is minimized in the (Z)-conformation and maximized in the (E)-conformation. center|377px ===n-n repulsions and C-H hydrogen bonding=== If the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygens at the anomeric center of 2-methoxypyran are shown, then a brief examination of the conformations of the anomers reveal that the β-anomer always has at least one pair of eclipsing (coplanar 1,3-interacting) lone pairs, this n-n repulsion is a high energy situation. On the other hand, the α-anomer has conformations in which there are no n-n repulsions, and that is true in the exo-anomeric conformation. The energetically unfavourable n-n repulsion present in the β-anomer, coupled with the energetically favourable hydrogen bond between the axial H-5 and a lone pair of electrons on the axial α-anomeric substituent (C-H/n hydrogen bond), have been suggested [references 7 and 8] to account for most of the energetic difference between the anomers, the anomeric effect. The molecular mechanics program StruMM3D, which is not specially parameterized for the anomeric effect, estimates that the dipolar contributions to the anomeric effect (primarily the n-n repulsion, and C-H hydrogen bonding discussed above) are about 1.5 kcal/mol. ==Influences== While the anomeric effect is a general explanation for this type of stabilization for a molecule, the type and amount of stabilization can be affected by the substituents being examined as well as the solvent being studied. ===Substituent effect=== In a closed system, there is a difference observed in the anomeric effect for different substituents on a cyclohexane or tetrahydropyran ring (Y=Oxygen). When X=OH, the generic anomeric effect can be seen, as previously explained. When X=CN, the same results are seen, where the equatorial position is preferred on the cyclohexane ring, but the axial position is preferred on the tetrahydropyran ring. This is consistent with the anomeric effect stabilization. When X=F, the anomeric effect is in fact observed for both rings. However, when X=NH2, no anomeric effect stabilization is observed and both systems prefer the equatorial position. This is attributed to both sterics and an effect called the reverse anomeric effect (see below). ===Solvent effect=== One common criticism of the hyperconjugation theory is that it fails to explain why the anomeric effect is not observed when substituted tetrahydropyran molecules are placed in polar solvents, and the equatorial position is once again preferred. It has been shown, however, that hyperconjugation does depend on the solvent in the system. Each of the substituted systems described above were tested in the gas phase (i.e. with no solvent) and in aqueous solution (i.e. polar solvent). When X=F, the anomeric effect was observed in both media, and the axial position was always preferred. This is attributed to hyperconjugation. When X=OH or CN, the anomeric effect was seen in the gas phase, when the axial position was preferred. However, in aqueous solutions, both substituents preferred the equatorial position. This is attributed to the fact that there are more electrostatic repulsions with the axial positioned substituent and the polar solvent, causing the equatorial position to be preferred. When X=NH2, again, no anomeric effect was observed and the equatorial position was always preferred. ===Overcoming the anomeric effect=== While the anomeric effect can cause stabilization of molecules, it does have a magnitude to its stabilization, and this value can be overcome by other, more destabilizing effects in some cases. center|377px In the example of spiroketals, the orientation on the upper left shows stabilization by the hyperconjugative anomeric effect twice, thus greatly stabilizing the orientation of the molecule. The orientation on the upper right only shows this hyperconjugative anomeric stabilization once, causing it to be the lesser preferred structure. However, when substituent are added onto the spiroketal backbone, the more preferred structure can be changed. When a large substituent is added to the spiroketal backbone, as seen in the lower left, the strain from having this large substituent, R, in the axial position is greatly destabilizing to the molecule. In the molecule on the lower right, R is now in the equatorial position, which no longer causes destabilization on the molecule. Therefore, without substituents, the upper equilibrium reaction is favored on the left hand side, while the lower equilibrium is favored on the right hand side, simply from the addition of a large, destabilizing substituent. ==Exo anomeric effect== An extension of the anomeric effect, the exo anomeric effect is the preference of substituents coming off a ring to adopt the gauche conformation, while sterics would suggest an antiperiplanar conformation would be preferred. center|433px An example of this is 2-methoxytetrahydropyran. As the anomeric effect predicts, the methoxy substituent shows an increased preference for the axial conformation. However, there is actually more than one possible axial conformation due to rotation about the C-O bond between the methoxy substituent and the ring. When one applies the principles of the reverse anomeric effect, it can be predicted that the gauche conformer is preferred, suggesting the top left conformation is best in the figure above. This prediction is supported by experimental evidence. Furthermore, this preference for the gauche position is still seen in the equatorial conformation. ==Reverse anomeric effect== This term refers to the apparent preference of positively charged nitrogen substituents for the equatorial conformation beyond what normal steric interactions would predict in rings containing an electronegative atom, such as oxygen. Substituents containing carbons with partial positive charges are not seen to exhibit the same effect. Theoretical explanations for the reverse anomeric effect include an electrostatic explanation and the delocalization of the sp3 electrons of the anomeric carbon and oxygen lone pair. There is some debate as to whether or not this is a real phenomenon. The nitrogen containing substituents it has been reported with are quite bulky, making it hard to separate the normal effects of steric bulk and the reverse anomeric effect, if it does exist. For example, in the molecule shown below, the pyridinium substituent strongly prefers the equatorial position, as steric factors would predict, but actually shows a stronger preference for this conformation than predicted, suggesting the reverse anomeric effect is contributing. center|433px ==Metallo-anomeric effect== Late transition metals from groups 10, 11, and 12 when placed at the anomeric carbon show strong axial preferences. This phenomenon termed as the metallo- anomeric effect originates from stabilizing hyperconjugative interactions between oxygen or other heteroatoms with lone pairs and C-M anti-bonding orbitals that act as good acceptors. The generalized metallo-anomeric effect refers to thermodynamic stabilization of synclinal conformers of compounds with the general formula M-CH2-OR. Axial/equatorial preferences can be influenced by ligands attached to the metal and electronic configuration. In general terms, moving from a lighter to a heavier element in the group, the magnitude of the metallo-anomeric effect increases. Furthermore, higher oxidation states favor axial/synclinal conformers. ==Synthetic applications== The anomeric effect is taken into consideration synthetically. Due to its discovery in sugars, sugar and carbohydrate chemistry is one of the more common synthetic uses of the anomeric effect. For instance, the Koenigs-Knorr glycosidation installs an α-OR or β-OR group in high diastereoselectivity which is effected by the anomeric effect. Sophorolipid lactone, (+)-Lepicidin A, and (−)-Lithospermoside are a few of the products synthesized via the Koenigs-Knorr Glycosidation overcoming the anomeric effect. center|700px ==See also== *Alkane stereochemistry *Anomer *Carbohydrate conformation *Conformational isomerism *Cyclohexane conformation *Gauche effect *Intramolecular forces *Monosaccharide *Raymond Lemieux *Steric effects ==References== ==External links== * Category:Carbohydrate chemistry Category:Physical organic chemistry Category:Carbohydrates Category:Acetals\n",

      "Trigonal planar molecular geometry[SEP]In chemistry, trigonal planar is a molecular geometry model with one atom at the center and three atoms at the corners of an equilateral triangle, called peripheral atoms, all in one plane. In an ideal trigonal planar species, all three ligands are identical and all bond angles are 120°. Such species belong to the point group D3h. Molecules where the three ligands are not identical, such as H2CO, deviate from this idealized geometry. Examples of molecules with trigonal planar geometry include boron trifluoride (BF3), formaldehyde (H2CO), phosgene (COCl2), and sulfur trioxide (SO3). Some ions with trigonal planar geometry include nitrate (), carbonate (), and guanidinium (). In organic chemistry, planar, three-connected carbon centers that are trigonal planar are often described as having sp2 hybridization. Nitrogen inversion is the distortion of pyramidal amines through a transition state that is trigonal planar. Pyramidalization is a distortion of this molecular shape towards a tetrahedral molecular geometry. One way to observe this distortion is in pyramidal alkenes. ==See also== *AXE method *Molecular geometry *VSEPR theory ==References== ==External links== *3D Chem Chemistry, Structures, and 3D Molecules *Indiana University Molecular Structure Center * Interactive molecular examples for point groups *Molecular Modeling *Animated Trigonal Planar Visual Category:Stereochemistry Category:Molecular geometry\n",

      "Giant oscillator strength[SEP]Giant oscillator strength is inherent in excitons that are weakly bound to impurities or defects in crystals. The spectrum of fundamental absorption of direct-gap semiconductors such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) is continuous and corresponds to band-to-band transitions. It begins with transitions at the center of the Brillouin zone, \\boldsymbol{k}=0. In a perfect crystal, this spectrum is preceded by a hydrogen-like series of the transitions to s-states of Wannier-Mott excitons. In addition to the exciton lines, there are surprisingly strong additional absorption lines in the same spectral region. They belong to excitons weakly bound to impurities and defects and are termed 'impurity excitons'. Anomalously high intensity of the impurity-exciton lines indicate their giant oscillator strength of about f_i\\sim10 per impurity center while the oscillator strength of free excitons is only of about f_{\\rm ex}\\sim10^{-4} per unit cell. Shallow impurity-exciton states are working as antennas borrowing their giant oscillator strength from vast areas of the crystal around them. They were predicted by Emmanuel Rashba first for molecular excitons and afterwards for excitons in semiconductors. Giant oscillator strengths of impurity excitons endow them with ultra-short radiational life-times \\tau_i\\sim1 ns. ==Bound excitons in semiconductors: Theory== Interband optical transitions happen at the scale of the lattice constant which is small compared to the exciton radius. Therefore, for large excitons in direct-gap crystals the oscillator strength f_{\\rm ex} of exciton absorption is proportional to |\\Phi_{\\rm ex}(0)|^2 which is the value of the square of the wave function of the internal motion inside the exciton \\Phi_{\\rm ex}(\\boldsymbol{r}_e-\\boldsymbol{r}_h) at coinciding values of the electron \\boldsymbol{r}_e and hole \\boldsymbol{r}_h coordinates. For large excitons |\\Phi_{\\rm ex}(0)|^2\\approx 1/a^3_{\\rm ex} where a_{\\rm ex} is the exciton radius, hence, f_{\\rm ex}\\approx v/a^3_{\\rm ex}\\ll1, here v is the unit cell volume. The oscillator strength f_i for producing a bound exciton can be expressed through its wave function \\Psi_i(\\boldsymbol{r}_e,\\boldsymbol{r}_h) and f_{\\rm ex} as f_i=\\frac{1}{v}\\frac{(\\int d\\boldsymbol{r}_e\\Psi_i(\\boldsymbol{r}_e,\\boldsymbol{r}_e))^2}{|\\Phi_{\\rm ex}(0)|^2}f_{\\rm ex} . Coinciding coordinates in the numerator, \\boldsymbol{r}_e=\\boldsymbol{r}_h, reflect the fact the exciton is created at a spatial scale small compared with its radius. The integral in the numerator can only be performed for specific models of impurity excitons. However, if the exciton is weakly bound to impurity, hence, the radius of the bound exciton a_i satisfies the condition a_i ≥ a_{\\rm ex} and its wave function of the internal motion \\Phi_{\\rm ex}(\\boldsymbol{r}_e-\\boldsymbol{r}_h) is only slightly distorted, then the integral in the numerator can be evaluated as (a_i/a_{\\rm ex})^{3/2}. This immediately results in an estimate for f_i f_i\\approx\\frac{a_i^3}{v}f_{\\rm ex} . This simple result reflects physics of the phenomenon of giant oscillator strength: coherent oscillation of electron polarization in the volume of about a_i^3 >> v. If the exciton is bound to a defect by a weak short-range potential, a more accurate estimate holds f_i=8\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{m}\\frac{E_{\\rm ex}}{E_i}\\right)^{3/2}\\frac{\\pi a^3_{\\rm ex}}{v}f_{\\rm ex}. Here m=m_e+m_h is the exciton effective mass, \\mu=(m_e^{-1}+m_h^{-1})^{-1} is its reduced mass, E_{\\rm ex} is the exciton ionization energy, E_i is the binding energy of the exciton to impurity, and m_e and m_h are the electron and hole effective masses. Giant oscillator strength for shallow trapped excitons results in their short radiative lifetimes \\tau_i\\approx\\frac{3m_0c^3}{2e^2n\\omega_i^2f_i} . Here m_0 is the electron mass in vacuum, c is the speed of light, n is the refraction index, and \\omega_i is the frequency of emitted light. Typical values of \\tau_i are about nanoseconds, and these short radiative lifetimes favor the radiative recombination of excitons over the non-radiative one. When quantum yield of radiative emission is high, the process can be considered as resonance fluorescence. Similar effects exist for optical transitions between exciton and biexciton states. An alternative description of the same phenomenon is in terms of polaritons: giant cross-sections of the resonance scattering of electronic polaritons on impurities and lattice defects. ==Bound excitons in semiconductors: Experiment== While specific values of f_i and \\tau_i are not universal and change within collections of specimens, typical values confirm the above regularities. In CdS, with E_i\\approx6 meV, were observed impurity- exciton oscillator strengths f_i\\approx 10. The value f_i>1 per a single impurity center should not be surprising because the transition is a collective process including many electrons in the region of the volume of about a_i^3>>v. High oscillator strength results in low-power optical saturation and radiative life times \\tau_i\\approx 500 ps. Similarly, radiative life times of about 1 ns were reported for impurity excitons in GaAs. The same mechanism is responsible for short radiative times down to 100 ps for excitons confined in CuCl microcrystallites. ==Bound molecular excitons== Similarly, spectra of weakly trapped molecular excitons are also strongly influenced by adjacent exciton bands. It is an important property of typical molecular crystals with two or more symmetrically-equivalent molecules in the elementary cell, such as benzine and naphthalene, that their exciton absorption spectra consist of doublets (or multiplets) of bands strongly polarized along the crystal axes as was demonstrated by Antonina Prikhot'ko. This splitting of strongly polarized absorption bands that originated from the same molecular level and is known as the 'Davydov splitting' is the primary manifestation of molecular excitons. If the low-frequency component of the exciton multiplet is situated at the bottom of the exciton energy spectrum, then the absorption band of an impurity exciton approaching the bottom from below is enhanced in this component of the spectrum and reduced in two other components; in the spectroscopy of molecular excitons this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the 'Rashba effect'. As a result, the polarization ratio of an impurity exciton band depends on its spectral position and becomes indicative of the energy spectrum of free excitons. In large organic molecules the energy of impurity excitons can be shifted gradually by changing the isotopic content of guest molecules. Building on this option, Vladimir Broude developed a method of studying the energy spectrum of excitons in the host crystal by changing the isotopic content of guest molecules.V. L. Broude, E. I. Rashba, and E. F. Sheka, Spectroscopy of molecular excitons (Springer, NY) 1985. Interchanging the host and the guest allows studying energy spectrum of excitons from the top. The isotopic technique has been more recently applied to study the energy transport in biological systems. ==See also== * Exciton * Polariton * Oscillator strength * Quantum yield * Resonance fluorescence ==References== Category:Condensed matter physics\n",

      "A value[SEP]A-values are numerical values used in the determination of the most stable orientation of atoms in a molecule (conformational analysis), as well as a general representation of steric bulk. A-values are derived from energy measurements of the different cyclohexane conformations of a monosubstituted cyclohexane chemical. Substituents on a cyclohexane ring prefer to reside in the equatorial position to the axial. The difference in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) between the higher energy conformation (axial substitution) and the lower energy conformation (equatorial substitution) is the A-value for that particular substituent. == Utility == A-values help predict the conformation of cyclohexane rings. The most stable conformation will be the one which has the substituent or substituents equatorial. When multiple substituents are taken into consideration, the conformation where the substituent with the largest A-value is equatorial is favored. thumb|600px|center|A methyl substituent has a significantly smaller A-value than a tert-butyl substituent; therefore the most stable conformation has the tert-butyl in the equatorial position. The utility of A-values can be generalized for use outside of cyclohexane conformations. A-values can help predict the steric effect of a substituent. In general, the larger a substituent's A-value, the larger the steric effect of that substituent. A methyl group has an A-value of 1.74 while tert-butyl group has an A-value of ~5. Because the A-value of tert-butyl is higher, tert-butyl has a larger steric effect than methyl. This difference in steric effects can be used to help predict reactivity in chemical reactions. == Free energy considerations == Steric effects play a major role in the assignment of configurations in cyclohexanes. One can use steric hindrances to determine the propensity of a substituent to reside in the axial or equatorial plane. It is known that axial bonds are more hindered than the corresponding equatorial bonds. This is because substituents in the axial position are relatively close to two other axial substituents. This makes it very crowded when bulky substituents are oriented in the axial position. These types of steric interactions are commonly known as 1,3 diaxial interactions. These types of interactions are not present with substituents at the equatorial position. There are generally considered three principle contributions to the conformational free energy: # Baeyer strain, defined as the strain arising from deformation of bond angles. # Pitzer strain, defined as the torsional strain arising from 1,2 interactions between groups attached to contiguous carbons, # Van der Waals interactions, which are similar to 1,3 diaxial interactions. === Enthalpic components === When comparing relative stability, 6- and 7-atom interactions can be used to approximate differences in enthalpy between conformations. Each 6-atom interaction is worth and each 7-atom interaction is worth . === Entropic components === Entropy also plays a role in a substituent's preference for the equatorial position. The entropic component is determined by the following formula: : \\Delta S = R \\ln \\sigma Where σ is equal to the number of microstates available for each conformation. thumb|350px|center|Possible axial conformations of ethyl cyclohexane. thumb|500px|center|Possible equatorial conformations of ethyl cyclohexane. Due to the larger number of possible conformations of ethyl cyclohexane, the A value is reduced from what would be predicted based purely on enthalpic terms. Due to these favorable entropic conditions, the steric relevance of an ethyl group is similar to that of a methyl substituent. == Table of A-values == A-values (in kcal/mol) of some common substituentsNote: measured under diverse conditions Substituent A-value Substituent A-value Substituent A-value D 0.006 CH2Br 1.79 OSi(CH3)3 0.74 F 0.15 CH(CH3)2 2.15 OH 0.87 Cl 0.43 c-C6H11 2.15 OCH3 0.6 Br 0.38 C(CH3)3 >4 OCD3 0.56 I 0.43 Ph 3 OCH2CH3 0.9 CN 0.17 CO2H 1.35 O-Ac 0.6 NC 0.21 CO2− 1.92 O-TFA 0.68 NCO 0.51 CO2CH3 1.27 OCHO 0.27 NCS 0.28 CO2Et 1.2 O-Ts 0.5 N=C=NR 1 CO2iPr 0.96 ONO2 0.59 CH3 1.7 COCl 1.25 NH2 1.6 CF3 2.1 COCH3 1.17 NHCH3 1 CH2CH3 1.75 SH 0.9 N(CH3)2 2.1 CH=CH2 1.35 SMe 0.7 NH3+ 1.9 CCH 0.41 SPh 0.8 NO2 1.1 CH2tBu 2 S− 1.3 HgBr ~0 CH2OTs 1.75 SOPh 1.9 HgCl 0.3 SO2Ph 2.5 Si(CH3)3 2.5 == Applications == === Predicting reactivity === One of the original experiments performed by Winston and Holness was measuring the rate of oxidation in trans and cis substituted rings using a chromium catalyst. The large tert-butyl group used locks the conformation of each molecule, placing it equatorial (cis compound shown). thumb|400px|center|Possible chair conformations of cis-4-tert-butyl- cyclohexan-1-ol It was observed that the cis compound underwent oxidation at a much faster rate than the trans compound. The proposition was that the large hydroxyl group in the axial position was disfavored and formed the carbonyl more readily to relieve this strain. The trans compound had rates identical to those found in the monosubstituted cyclohexanol. thumb|400px| center| Chromium oxidation of cis-4-tert-butyl-cyclohexan-1-ol === Approximating intramolecular force strength using A-values === Using the A-values of the hydroxyl and isopropyl subunit, the energetic value of a favorable intramolecular hydrogen bond can be calculated. Enforcement Directive thumb|400px| center| Possible chair conformations and the favorable hydrogen bond available in the conformation where both hydroxyl substituents are equatorial == Limitations == A-Values are measured using a mono-substituted cyclohexane ring, and are an indication of only the sterics a particular substituent imparts on the molecule. This leads to a problem when there are possible stabilizing electronic factors in a different system. The carboxylic acid substituent shown below is axial in the ground state, despite a positive A-value. From this observation, it is clear that there are other possible electronic interactions that stabilize the axial conformation. thumb|400px| center|Equilibrium representation of a chair flip of a carboxylic acid; the axial position is preferred due to favorable electronic factors, despite a steric bias favoring the equatorial position. == Other considerations == It is important to note that A-values do not predict the physical size of a molecule, only the steric effect. For example, the tert-butyl group (A-value=4.9) has a larger A-value than the trimethylsilyl group (A-value=2.5), yet the tert-butyl group actually occupies less space. This difference can be attributed to the longer length of the carbon–silicon bond as compared to the carbon–carbon bond of the tert-butyl group. The longer bond allows for less interactions with neighboring substituents, which effectively makes the trimethylsilyl group less sterically hindering, thus, lowering its A-value. This can also be seen when comparing the halogens. Bromine, iodine, and chlorine all have similar A-values even though their atomic radii differ. A-values then, predict the apparent size of a substituent, and the relative apparent sizes determine the differences in steric effects between compounds. Thus, A-values are useful tools in determining compound reactivity in chemical reactions. == References == Category:Isomerism Category:Physical organic chemistry\n",

      "Academic history[SEP]An academic history can be a large, multivolume work such as the Cambridge Modern History, written collaboratively under some central editorial control. In the 19th century the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time - in a similar manner to the way in which people compiled an encyclopedia. The chosen time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure resembled that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series produced by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of \"academic history\" its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", challenged by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th century there weren't any more new academic histories. Historians no longer subdivided their subject-matter in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the academic-history projects mentioned above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. Some new global histories resemble the academic histories, in that they are large and done by many people using a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern. == See also == * Academia * History of scholarship Category:Historiography\n",

Such megastructures could have a variety of advantages over natural planets, such as efficient use of solar energy and immense living space, but their construction and/or maintenance would require technologies so much more advanced than those of 21st-century Earth that it is currently unknown if they are even achievable. It was often stated, that it is more possible to build a 2-gigaton Dyson sphere than a laser rifle, but still ringworlds etc. are treated in sci-fi as symbol of immense power, often relic of Precursor civilization or symbol of all-powerful future empire. Examples of artificial worlds include: *Culture Orbitals *Dyson spheres *Globus Cassus *Ringworld The main plot of the Neill Blomkamp science fiction action movie Elysium focuses on a dystopian future where the poor live on a post apocalyptic Earth in ruins, working in nightmarish city conditions and patrolled by robotic officers while the rich live on a Stanford torus design man made planet known as Elysium that hovers just above Earth that has many technological pleasures and machines that can fix almost any health ailment known to man. In Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, an advanced race referred to as the Magratheans designed and built planets for the wealthy inhabitants of the galaxy, and the book went on to theorize that the Magratheans also designed and built Earth.

      "The Millennial Project[SEP]The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps by Marshall T. Savage is a book (published in 1992 and reprinted in 1994 with an introduction by Arthur C. Clarke) in the field of exploratory engineering that gives a series of concrete stages the author believes will lead to interstellar colonization. Many specific scientific and engineering details are presented, as are numerous issues involved in space colonization. ==The book's thesis== Savage takes a Malthusian view of the exponential growth of human population and life in general, and also recommends the exponential growth of blue-green algae for sustenance. He states that it is humanity's destiny to colonize every star in the galaxy. He draws heavily on the Fermi paradox (briefly stated as, \"If there is intelligent life in space, why haven't we found it yet?\") to support his position that it is humanity's burden alone to ignite the universe with the \"spark of Life.\" In The Millennial Project, he calls for the creation of an international foundation to realize these goals. Originally known as the First Millennial Foundation (founded by Savage in 1987), the organization changed its name to the Living Universe Foundation. ==The steps of the project== The \"Eight Easy Steps\" proposed by Savage are as follows: # Foundationconstitute an organization convened to realize these destinies. # Aquariusbuild arcologies in the tropical oceans as a first step to learning how to build (\"grow\"Savage, Marshall T., The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps, 2nd edition, 1994, p 73) colonies in space using a method not unlike that used by living coralsHilbertz, W.

      "Planet Simulator[SEP]The Planet Simulator (also known as a Planetary Simulator) is a machine designed to study the origin of life on planet Earth and beyond. The simulator machine was announced by researchers at McMaster University on behalf of the Origins Institute on 4 October 2018. The machine was developed primarily to study a theory that suggests life on early Earth began in \"warm little ponds\", rather than in deep ocean vents, nearly four billion years ago. The simulator can recreate conditions of the primitive Earth to see whether cellular life can be created, and then later, evolve. According to physicist Maikel Rheinstadter, who is also the director of the simulator project, \"We want to understand how the first living cell was formed - how the Earth moved from a chemical world to a biological world.\" The one-of-a-kind planet simulator, manufactured by Angstrom Engineering Inc., can control temperature, humidity, pressure, atmosphere and radiation levels that may be consistent with conditions on the early Earth, or conditions on other astronomical bodies, including other planets, exoplanets and the like. The simulator project, begun in 2012, was funded with $1 million from the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Ontario government and McMaster University, and was built by Angstrom Engineering Inc of Kitchener, Ontario. ==Observations== According to researchers, preliminary tests with the simulator, under possible conditions of the early Earth, created protocells: cells which are not living but very important nonetheless. According to biologist David Deamer, the machine is a game changer, and the cells produced so far are \"significant\". The \"cells are not alive, but are evolutionary steps toward a living system of molecules ... [the simulator] opens up a lot of experimental activities that were literally impossible before.” Based on initial tests with the new simulator technology, project director Rheinstadter stated that it \"seems that the formation of life is probably a relatively frequent process in the universe\". ==References== ==External links== * at the Origins Institute of McMaster University * – Angstrom Engineering Inc * – McMaster University Category:Astrobiology Category:Evolutionary biology Category:Origin of life Category:Prebiotic chemistry\n",

      "Planetary protection[SEP]Planetary protection is a guiding principle in the design of an interplanetary mission, aiming to prevent biological contamination of both the target celestial body and the Earth in the case of sample-return missions. Planetary protection reflects both the unknown nature of the space environment and the desire of the scientific community to preserve the pristine nature of celestial bodies until they can be studied in detail. There are two types of interplanetary contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of viable organisms from Earth to another celestial body. Back contamination is the transfer of extraterrestrial organisms, if they exist, back to the Earth's biosphere. ==History== The potential problem of lunar and planetary contamination was first raised at the International Astronautical Federation VIIth Congress in Rome in 1956. In 1958Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars (2006) - Page 12 the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) passed a resolution stating, “The National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America urges that scientists plan lunar and planetary studies with great care and deep concern so that initial operations do not compromise and make impossible forever after critical scientific experiments.” This led to creation of the ad hoc Committee on Contamination by Extraterrestrial Exploration (CETEX), which met for a year and recommended that interplanetary spacecraft be sterilized, and stated, “The need for sterilization is only temporary. Mars and possibly Venus need to remain uncontaminated only until study by manned ships becomes possible”.Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars In 1959, planetary protection was transferred to the newly formed Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). COSPAR in 1964 issued Resolution 26 affirming that: In 1967, the US, USSR, and UK ratified the United Nations Outer Space Treaty. The legal basis for planetary protection lies in Article IX of this treaty: This treaty has since been signed and ratified by 104 nation-states. Another 24 have signed but not ratified. All the current space- faring nation-states, along with all current aspiring space-faring nation- states, have both signed and ratified the treaty. The Outer Space Treaty has consistent and widespread international support, and as a result of this, together with the fact that it is based on the 1963 declaration which was adopted by consensus in the UN National Assembly, it has taken on the status of customary international law. The provisions of the Outer Space Treaty are therefore binding on all states, even those who have neither signed nor ratified it. For forward contamination, the phrase to be interpreted is \"harmful contamination\". Two legal reviews came to differing interpretations of this clause (both reviews were unofficial). However the currently accepted interpretation is that “any contamination which would result in harm to a state’s experiments or programs is to be avoided”. NASA policy states explicitly that “the conduct of scientific investigations of possible extraterrestrial life forms, precursors, and remnants must not be jeopardized”.Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars, page 13 Summarizes this para in the book: ==COSPAR recommendations and categories== The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) meets every two years, in a gathering of 2000 to 3000 scientists,COSPAR scientific assemblies and one of its tasks is to develop recommendations for avoiding interplanetary contamination. Its legal basis is Article IX of the Outer Space Treaty (see history below for details). Its recommendations depend on the type of space mission and the celestial body explored.COSPAR PLANETARY PROTECTION POLICY (20 October 2002; As Amended to 24 March 2011) COSPAR categorizes the missions into 5 groups: *Category I: Any mission to locations not of direct interest for chemical evolution or the origin of life, such as the Sun or Mercury. No planetary protection requirements. *Category II: Any mission to locations of significant interest for chemical evolution and the origin of life, but only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne contamination could compromise investigations. Examples include the Moon, Venus, and comets. Requires simple documentation only, primarily to outline intended or potential impact targets, and an end of mission report of any inadvertent impact site if such occurred. *Category III: Flyby and orbiter missions to locations of significant interest for chemical evolution or the origin of life, and with a significant chance that contamination could compromise investigations e.g., Mars, Europa, Enceladus. Requires more involved documentation than Category II. Other requirements, depending on the mission, may include trajectory biasing, clean room assembly, bioburden reduction, and if impact is a possibility, inventory of organics. *Category IV: Lander or probe missions to the same locations as Category III. Measures to be applied depend on the target body and the planned operations. \"Sterilization of the entire spacecraft may be required for landers and rovers with life-detection experiments, and for those landing in or moving to a region where terrestrial microorganisms may survive and grow, or where indigenous life may be present. For other landers and rovers, the requirements would be for decontamination and partial sterilization of the landed hardware.\" :: Missions to Mars in category IV are subclassified further: :*Category IVa. Landers that do not search for Martian life - uses the Viking lander pre-sterilization requirements, a maximum of 300,000 spores per spacecraft and 300 spores per square meter. :*Category IVb. Landers that search for Martian life. Adds stringent extra requirements to prevent contamination of samples. :*Category IVc. Any component that accesses a Martian special region (see below) must be sterilized to at least to the Viking post-sterilization biological burden levels of 30 spores total per spacecraft. *Category V: This is further divided into unrestricted and restricted sample return. :* Unrestricted Category V: samples from locations judged by scientific opinion to have no indigenous lifeforms. No special requirements. :* Restricted Category V: (where scientific opinion is unsure) the requirements include: absolute prohibition of destructive impact upon return, containment of all returned hardware which directly contacted the target body, and containment of any unsterilized sample returned to Earth. For Category IV missions, a certain level of biological burden is allowed for the mission. In general this is expressed as a 'probability of contamination', required to be less than one chance in 10,000 of forward contamination per mission, but in the case of Mars Category IV missions (above) the requirement has been translated into a count of Bacillus spores per surface area, as an easy to use assay method. More extensive documentation is also required for Category IV. Other procedures required, depending on the mission, may include trajectory biasing, the use of clean rooms during spacecraft assembly and testing, bioload reduction, partial sterilization of the hardware having direct contact with the target body, a bioshield for that hardware, and, in rare cases, complete sterilization of the entire spacecraft. For restricted Category V missions, the current recommendationMars Sample Return backward contamination – Strategic advice and requirements - foreword and section 1.2 is that no uncontained samples should be returned unless sterilized. Since sterilization of the returned samples would destroy much of their science value, current proposals involve containment and quarantine procedures. For details, see Containment and quarantine below. Category V missions also have to fulfill the requirements of Category IV to protect the target body from forward contamination. ===Mars special regions=== A special region is a region classified by COSPAR where terrestrial organisms could readily propagate, or thought to have a high potential for existence of Martian life forms. This is understood to apply to any region on Mars where liquid water occurs, or can occasionally occur, based on the current understanding of requirements for life. If a hard landing risks biological contamination of a special region, then the whole lander system must be sterilized to COSPAR category IVc. ==Target categories== Some targets are easily categorized. Others are assigned provisional categories by COSPAR, pending future discoveries and research. The 2009 COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Outer Planet Satellites and Small Solar System Bodies covered this in some detail. Most of these assessments are from that report, with some future refinements. This workshop also gave more precise definitions for some of the categories:COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Outer Planet Satellites and Small Solar System Bodies European Space Policy Institute (ESPI), 15–17 April 2009COSPAR power point type presentation, gives good overview of the detailed category decisions ===Category I=== * Io, Sun, Mercury, undifferentiated metamorphosed asteroids ===Category II=== * Callisto, comets, asteroids of category P, D, and C, Venus, Kuiper belt objects (KBO) < 1/2 size of Pluto. ===Provisional Category II=== * Ganymede, Titan, Triton, the Pluto–Charon system, and other large KBOs (> 1/2 size of Pluto), Ceres Provisionally, they assigned these objects to Category II. However, they state that more research is needed, because there is a remote possibility that the tidal interactions of Pluto and Charon could maintain some water reservoir below the surface. Similar considerations apply to the other larger KBOs. Triton is insufficiently well understood at present to say it is definitely devoid of liquid water. The only close up observations to date are those of Voyager 2. In a detailed discussion of Titan, scientists concluded that there was no danger of contamination of its surface, except short term adding of negligible amounts of organics, but Titan could have a below surface water reservoir that communicates with the surface, and if so, this could be contaminated. In the case of Ganymede, the question is, given that its surface shows pervasive signs of resurfacing, is there any communication with its subsurface ocean? They found no known mechanism by which this could happen, and the Galileo spacecraft found no evidence of cryovolcanism. Initially, they assigned it as Priority B minus, meaning that precursor missions are needed to assess its category before any surface missions. However, after further discussion they provisionally assigned it to Category II, so no precursor missions are required, depending on future research. If there is cryovolcanism on Ganymede or Titan, the undersurface reservoir is thought to be 50 – 150 km below the surface. They were unable to find a process that could transfer the surface melted water back down through 50 km of ice to the under surface sea. This is why both Ganymede and Titan were assigned a reasonably firm provisional Category II, but pending results of future research. Icy bodies that show signs of recent resurfacing need further discussion and might need to be assigned to a new category depending on future research. This approach has been applied, for instance, to missions to Ceres. The planetary protection Category is subject for review during the mission of the Ceres orbiter (Dawn) depending on the results found.Catharine Conley Planetary Protection for the Dawn Mission, NASA HQ, Jan 2013 ===Category III / IV=== * Mars because of possible subsurface habitats. * Europa because of its subsurface ocean. * Enceladus because of evidence of water plumes. ===Category V=== In the category V for sample return the conclusions so far are: * Unrestricted Category V: Venus, the Moon. * Restricted Category V: Mars, Europa, Enceladus. ==The Coleman–Sagan equation== The aim of the current regulations is to keep the number of microorganisms low enough so that the probability of contamination of Mars (and other targets) is acceptable. It is not an objective to make the probability of contamination zero. The aim is to keep the probability of contamination of 1 chance in 10,000 of contamination per mission flown. This figure is obtained typically by multiplying together the number of microorganisms on the spacecraft, the probability of growth on the target body, and a series of bioload reduction factors. In detail the method used is the Coleman–Sagan equation.edited by Muriel Gargaud, Ricardo Amils, Henderson James Cleaves, Michel Viso, Daniele Pinti Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Volume 1 page 325 P_c = N_0 R P_S P_t P_R P_g. where : N_0 = the number of microorganisms on the spacecraft initially : R = Reduction due to conditions on spacecraft before and after launch : P_S = Probability that microorganisms on the spacecraft reach the surface of the planet : P_t = Probability that spacecraft will hit the planet - this is 1 for a lander : P_R = Probability of microorganism to be released in the environment when on the ground, usually set to 1 for crashlanding. : P_g = Probability of growth. For targets with liquid water this is set to 1 for sake of the calculation. Then the requirement is P_c < 10^{-4} The 10^{-4} is a number chosen by Sagan et al., somewhat arbitrarily. Sagan and Coleman assumed that about 60 missions to the Mars surface would occur before the exobiology of Mars is thoroughly understood, 54 of those successful, and 30 flybys or orbiters, and the number was chosen to endure a probability to keep the planet free from contamination of at least 99.9% over the duration of the exploration period.Carl Sagan and Sidney Coleman Decontamination Standards for Martian Exploration Programs, Chapter 28 from Biology and the Exploration of Mars: Report of a Study edited by Colin Stephenson Pittendrigh, Wolf Vishniac, J. P. T. Pearman, National Academies, 1966 - Life on other planets ===Critiques=== The Coleman–Sagan equation has been criticised because the individual parameters are often not known to better than a magnitude or so. For example, the thickness of the surface ice of Europa is unknown, and may be thin in places, which can give rise to a high level of uncertainty in the equation.Richard Greenberg, Richard J. Greenberg Unmasking Europa: the search for life on Jupiter's ocean moon It has also been criticised because of the inherent assumption made of an end to the protection period and future human exploration. In the case of Europa, this would only protect it with reasonable probability for the duration of the period of exploration. Greenberg has suggested an alternative, to use the natural contamination standard — that our missions to Europa should not have a higher chance of contaminating it than the chance of contamination by meteorites from Earth.Europa the Ocean Moon, Search for an Alien Biosphere, chapter 21.5.2 Standards and Risks Another approach for Europa is the use of binary decision trees which is favoured by the Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System under the auspices of the Space Studies Board.Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System - about the Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System This goes through a series of seven steps, leading to a final decision on whether to go ahead with the mission or not.Committee on Planetary Protection Standards for Icy Bodies in the Outer Solar System; Space Studies Board; Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences; National Research Council Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Spacecraft Missions to Icy Solar System Bodies (2012) / 2 Binary Decision Trees ==Containment and quarantine for restricted Category V sample return== In the case of restricted Category V missions, Earth would be protected through quarantine of sample and astronauts in a yet to be built Biosafety level 4 facility. In the case of a Mars sample return, missions would be designed so that no part of the capsule that encounters the Mars surface is exposed to the Earth environment. One way to do that is to enclose the sample container within a larger outer container from Earth, in the vacuum of space. The integrity of any seals is essential and the system must also be monitored to check for the possibility of micro-meteorite damage during return to Earth.Office of Planetary Protection: Mars Sample Quarantine Protocol WorkshopMars sample return mission concept study (for decadal review 2010)Proof of concept of a Bio-Containment System for Mars Sample Return Mission The recommendation of the ESF report is that No restricted category V returns have been carried out. During the Apollo program, the sample-returns were regulated through the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law. This was rescinded in 1991, so new regulations would need to be enacted. The Apollo era quarantine procedures are of interest as the only attempt to date of a return to Earth of a sample that, at the time, was thought to have a remote possibility of including extraterrestrial life. Samples and astronauts were quarantined in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.Richard S. Johnston, John A. Mason, Bennie C. Wooley, Gary W. McCollum, Bernard J. Mieszkuc BIOMEDICAL RESULTS OF APOLLO, SECTION V, CHAPTER 1, THE LUNAR QUARANTINE PROGRAM The methods used would be considered inadequate for containment by modern standards.Nancy Atkinson How to Handle Moon Rocks and Lunar Bugs: A Personal History of Apollo’s Lunar Receiving Lab, Universe Today, July 2009. See quote from: McLane who lead the group that designed and built the Lunar Receiving Facility: Also the lunar receiving laboratory would be judged a failure by its own design criteria as the sample return didn't contain the lunar material, with two failure points during the Apollo 11 return mission, at the splashdown and at the facility itself. However the Lunar Receiving Laboratory was built quickly with only two years from start to finish, a time period now considered inadequate. Lessons learned from it can help with design of any Mars sample return receiving facility.The Quarantine and Certification of Martian Samples - Chapter 7: Lessons Learned from the Quarantine of Apollo Lunar Samples, Committee on Planetary and Lunar Exploration, Space Studies Board Design criteria for a proposed Mars Sample Return Facility, and for the return mission, have been developed by the American National Research Council, and the European Space Foundation.European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - strategic advice July, 2012, They concluded that it could be based on biohazard 4 containment but with more stringent requirements to contain unknown microorganisms possibly as small as or smaller than the smallest Earth microorganisms known, the ultramicrobacteria. The ESF study also recommended that it should be designed to contain the smaller gene transfer agents if possible, as these could potentially transfer DNA from martian microorganisms to terrestrial microorganisms if they have a shared evolutionary ancestry. It also needs to double as a clean room facility to protect the samples from terrestrial contamination that could confuse the sensitive life detection tests that would be used on the samples. Before a sample return, new quarantine laws would be required. Environmental assessment would also be required, and various other domestic and international laws not present during the Apollo era would need to be negotiated.M. S. Race Planetary Protection, Legal Ambiguity, and the Decision Making Process for Mars Sample Return Adv. Space Res. vol 18 no 1/2 pp (1/2)345-(1/2)350 1996 ==Decontamination procedures== For all spacecraft missions requiring decontamination, the starting point is clean room assembly in US federal standard class 100 cleanrooms. These are rooms with fewer than 100 particles of size 0.5 µm or larger per cubic foot. Engineers wear cleanroom suits with only their eyes exposed. Components are sterilized individually before assembly, as far as possible, and they clean surfaces frequently with alcohol wipes during assembly. Spores of Bacillus subtilis was chosen for not only its ability to readily generate spores, but its well-established use as a model species. It is a useful tracker of UV irradiation effects because of its high resilience to a variety of extreme conditions. As such it is an important indicator species for forward contamination in the context of planetary protection. For Category IVa missions (Mars landers that do not search for Martian life), the aim is to reduce the bioburden to 300,000 bacterial spores on any surface from which the spores could get into the Martian environment. Any heat tolerant components are heat sterilized to 114 °C. Sensitive electronics such as the core box of the rover including the computer, are sealed and vented through high-efficiency filters to keep any microbes inside.In-situ Exploration and Sample Return: Planetary Protection Technologies JPL - Mars Exploration Rovers For more sensitive missions such as Category IVc (to Mars special regions), a far higher level of sterilization is required. These need to be similar to levels implemented on the Viking landers, which were sterilized for a surface which, at the time, was thought to be potentially hospitable to life similar to special regions on Mars today. In microbiology, it is usually impossible to prove that there are no microorganisms left viable, since many microorganisms are either not yet studied, or not cultivable. Instead, sterilization is done using a series of tenfold reductions of the numbers of microorganisms present. After a sufficient number of tenfold reductions, the chance that there any microorganisms left will be extremely low. The two Viking Mars landers were sterilized using dry heat sterilization. After preliminary cleaning to reduce the bioburden to levels similar to present day Category IVa spacecraft, the Viking spacecraft were heat-treated for 30 hours at 112 °C, nominal 125 °C (five hours at 112 °C was considered enough to reduce the population tenfold even for enclosed parts of the spacecraft, so this was enough for a million- fold reduction of the originally low population). Modern materials however are often not designed to handle such temperatures, especially since modern spacecraft often use \"commercial off the shelf\" components. Problems encountered include nanoscale features only a few atoms thick, plastic packaging, and conductive epoxy attachment methods. Also many instrument sensors cannot be exposed to high temperature, and high temperature can interfere with critical alignments of instruments. As a result, new methods are needed to sterilize a modern spacecraft to the higher categories such as Category IVc for Mars, similar to Viking. Methods under evaluation, or already approved, include: * Vapour phase hydrogen peroxide - effective, but can affect finishes, lubricants and materials that use aromatic rings and sulfur bonds. This has been established, reviewed, and a NASA/ESA specification for use of VHP has been approved by the Planetary Protection Officer, but it has not yet been formally published.Fei Chen, Terri Mckay, James Andy Spry, Anthony Colozza, Salvador Distefano, Robert Cataldo Planetary Protection Concerns During Pre-Launch Radioisotope Power System Final Integration Activities - includes the draft specification of VHP sterilization and details of how it would be implemented. Proceedings of Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space 2013. Albuquerque, NM, February 25–28, 2013 Paper 6766 * Ethylene oxide - this is widely used in the medical industry, and can be used for materials not compatible with hydrogen peroxide. It is under consideration for missions such as ExoMars. * Gamma radiation and electron beams have been suggested as a method of sterilization, as they are used extensively in the medical industry. They need to be tested for compatibility with spacecraft materials and hardware geometries, and are not yet ready for review. Some other methods are of interest as they can sterilize the spacecraft after arrival on the planet. * Supercritical carbon dioxide snow (Mars) - is most effective against traces of organic compounds rather than whole microorganisms. Has the advantage though that it eliminates the organic traces - while other methods kill the microorganisms, they leave organic traces that can confuse life detection instruments. Is under study by JPL and ESA. * Passive sterilization through UV radiation (Mars). Highly effective against many microorganisms, but not all, as a Bacillus strain found in spacecraft assembly facilities is particularly resistant to UV radiation. Is also complicated by possible shadowing by dust and spacecraft hardware. * Passive sterilization through particle fluxes (Europa). Plans for missions to Europa take credit for reductions due to this. ===Bioburden detection and assessment=== The spore count is used as an indirect measure of the number of microorganisms present. Typically 99% of microorganisms by species will be non-spore forming and able to survive in dormant states, and so the actual number of viable dormant microorganisms remaining on the sterilized spacecraft is expected to be many times the number of spore-forming microorganisms. One new spore method approved is the \"Rapid Spore Assay\". This is based on commercial rapid assay systems, detects spores directly and not just viable microorganisms and gives results in 5 hours instead of 72 hours.Assessment of Planetary Protection and Contamination Control Technologies for Future Planetary Science Missions see Section 3.1.2 Bio-burden Detection and Assessment. January 24, JPL, 2011 ===Challenges=== It is also long been recognized that spacecraft cleaning rooms harbour polyextremophiles as the only microbes able to survive in them. For example, in a recent study, microbes from swabs of the Curiosity rover were subjected to desiccation, UV exposure, cold and pH extremes. Nearly 11% of the 377 strains survived more than one of these severe conditions. The genomes of resistant spore producing Bacillus sp. have been studied and genome level traits potentially linked to the resistance have been reported. This does not mean that these microbes have contaminated Mars. This is just the first stage of the process of bioburden reduction. To contaminate Mars they also have to survive the low temperature, vacuum, UV and ionizing radiation during the months long journey to Mars, and then have to encounter a habitat on Mars and start reproducing there. Whether this has happened or not is a matter of probability. The aim of planetary protection is to make this probability as low as possible. The currently accepted target probability of contamination per mission is to reduce it to less than 0.01%, though in the special case of Mars, scientists also rely on the hostile conditions on Mars to take the place of the final stage of heat treatment decimal reduction used for Viking. But with current technology scientists cannot reduce probabilities to zero. ===New methods=== Two recent molecular methods have been approved for assessment of microbial contamination on spacecraft surfaces. * Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection - this is a key element in cellular metabolism. This method is able to detect non cultivable organisms. It can also be triggered by non viable biological material so can give a \"false positive\". * Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay - detects lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This compound is only present in Gram- negative bacteria. The standard assay analyses spores from microbes that are primarily Gram-positive, making it difficult to relate the two methods. ==Impact prevention== This particularly applies to orbital missions, Category III, as they are sterilized to a lower standard than missions to the surface. It is also relevant to landers, as an impact gives more opportunity for forward contamination, and impact could be on an unplanned target, such as a special region on Mars. The requirement for an orbital mission is that it needs to remain in orbit for at least 20 years after arrival at Mars with probability of at least 99% and for 50 years with probability at least 95%. This requirement can be dropped if the mission is sterilized to Viking sterilization standard.Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars ( 2006 ) Page 27 (footnote to page 26) of chapter 2 Policies and Practices in Planetary Protection In the Viking era (1970s), the requirement was given as a single figure, that any orbital mission should have a probability of less than 0.003% probability of impact during the current exploratory phase of exploration of Mars.Preventing the Forward Contamination of Mars ( 2006 ) Page 22 of chapter 2 Policies and Practices in Planetary Protection For both landers and orbiters, the technique of trajectory biasing is used during approach to the target. The spacecraft trajectory is designed so that if communications are lost, it will miss the target. ===Issues with impact prevention=== Despite these measures there has been one notable failure of impact prevention. The Mars Climate Orbiter which was sterilized only to Category III, crashed on Mars in 1999 due to a mix-up of imperial and metric units. The office of planetary protection stated that it is likely that it burnt up in the atmosphere, but if it survived to the ground, then it could cause forward contamination.Mars Climate Orbiter page at Mars Observer is another Category III mission with potential planetary contamination. Communications were lost three days before its orbital insertion maneuver in 1993. It seems most likely it did not succeed in entering into orbit around Mars and simply continued past on a heliocentric orbit. If it did succeed in following its automatic programming, and attempted the manoeuvre, however, there is a chance it crashed on Mars. Three landers have had hard landings on Mars. These are Schiaparelli EDM lander, the Mars Polar Lander, and Deep Space 2. These were all sterilized for surface missions but not for special regions (Viking pre- sterilization only). Mars Polar Lander, and Deep Space 2 crashed into the polar regions which are now treated as special regions because of the possibility of forming liquid brines. ==Controversies== ===Meteorite argument=== Alberto G. Fairén and Dirk Schulze-Makuch published an article in Nature recommending that planetary protection measures need to be scaled down. They gave as their main reason for this, that exchange of meteorites between Earth and Mars means that any life on Earth that could survive on Mars has already got there and vice versa. Robert Zubrin used similar arguments in favour of his view that the back contamination risk has no scientific validity.Robert Zubrin \"Contamination From Mars: No Threat\", The Planetary Report July/Aug. 2000, P.4–5transcription of a tele-conference interview with Robert Zubrin conducted on March 30, 2001 by the class members of STS497 I, \"Space Colonization\"; Instructor: Dr. Chris Churchill ===Rebuttal by NRC=== The meteorite argument was examined by the NRC in the context of back contamination. It is thought that all the Martian meteorites originate in relatively few impacts every few million years on Mars. The impactors would be kilometers in diameter and the craters they form on Mars tens of kilometers in diameter. Models of impacts on Mars are consistent with these findings.O. Eugster, G. F. Herzog, K. Marti, M. W. Caffee Irradiation Records, Cosmic-Ray Exposure Ages, and Transfer Times of Meteorites, see section 4.5 Martian Meteorites LPI, 2006L.E. NYQUIST1, D.D. BOGARD1, C.-Y. SHIH2, A. GRESHAKE3, D. STÖFFLER AGES AND GEOLOGIC HISTORIES OF MARTIAN METEORITES 2001Tony Irving Martian Meteorites - has graphs of ejection ages - site maintained by Tony Irving for up to date information on Martian meteorites Earth receives a steady stream of meteorites from Mars, but they come from relatively few original impactors, and transfer was more likely in the early Solar System. Also some life forms viable on both Mars and on Earth might be unable to survive transfer on a meteorite, and there is so far no direct evidence of any transfer of life from Mars to Earth in this way. The NRC concluded that though transfer is possible, the evidence from meteorite exchange does not eliminate the need for back contamination protection methods. Impacts on Earth able to send microorganisms to Mars are also infrequent. Impactors of 10 km across or larger can send debris to Mars through the Earth's atmosphere but these occur rarely, and were more common in the early Solar System. === Proposal to end planetary protection for Mars === In their 2013 paper \"The Over Protection of Mars\", Alberto Fairén and Dirk Schulze-Makuch suggested that we no longer need to protect Mars, essentially using Zubrin's meteorite transfer argument.The overprotection of Mars This was rebutted in a follow up article \"Appropriate Protection of Mars\", in Nature by the current and previous planetary protection officers Catharine Conley and John Rummel.Appropriate protection of Mars, Nature, Catherine Conley and John RummelThe Overprotection of Mars?, astrobio.net, Andrew Williams - Nov 18, 2013 - summarizes both papers on the subject, with links to originals ===Critique of Category V containment measures === The scientific consensus is that the potential for large-scale effects, either through pathogenesis or ecological disruption, is extremely small.NASA.gov Preliminary Planning for an International Mars Sample Return Mission Report of the International Mars Architecture for the Return of Samples (iMARS) Working Group June 1, 2008European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - Strategic advice and requirements July, 2012, - see Back Planetary Protection section.

Task Group on Issues in Sample Return. National Academies Press, Washington, DC (1997). Nevertheless, returned samples from Mars will be treated as potentially biohazardous until scientists can determine that the returned samples are safe. The goal is to reduce the probability of release of a Mars particle to less than one in a million. == Policy proposals == ===Non-biological contamination=== A COSPAR workshop in 2010, looked at issues to do with protecting areas from non biological contamination.Rummel, J., Race, M., and Horneck, G. eds. 2011. COSPAR Workshop on Ethical Considerations for Planetary Protection in Space Exploration COSPAR, Paris, 51 pp. They recommended that COSPAR expand its remit to include such issues. Recommendations of the workshop include: Some ideas proposed include protected special regions, or \"Planetary Parks\"'Planetary Parks' Could Protect Space Wilderness by Leonard David, SPACE.com’s Space Insider Columnist, January 17, 2013 to keep regions of the Solar System pristine for future scientific investigation, and also for ethical reasons. ===Proposed extensions=== Astrobiologist Christopher McKay has argued that until we have better understanding of Mars, our explorations should be biologically reversible.Christopher P. McKay Planetary Ecosynthesis on Mars: Restoration Ecology and Environmental Ethics NASA Ames Research Center For instance if all the microorganisms introduced to Mars so far remain dormant within the spacecraft, they could in principle be removed in the future, leaving Mars completely free of contamination from modern Earth lifeforms. In the 2010 workshop one of the recommendations for future consideration was to extend the period for contamination prevention to the maximum viable lifetime of dormant microorganisms introduced to the planet. In the case of Europa, a similar idea has been suggested, that it is not enough to keep it free from contamination during our current exploration period. It might be that Europa is of sufficient scientific interest that the human race has a duty to keep it pristine for future generations to study as well. This was the majority view of the 2000 task force examining Europa, though there was a minority view of the same task force that such strong protection measures are not required. In July 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine issued a Review and Assessment of Planetary Protection Policy Development Processes. In part, the report urges NASA to create a broad strategic plan that covers both forward and back contamination. The report also expresses concern about private industry missions, for which there is no governmental regulatory authority. === Protecting objects beyond the Solar System === The proposal by the German physicist Claudius Gros, that the technology of the Breakthrough Starshot project may be utilized to establish a biosphere of unicellular organisms on otherwise only transiently habitable exoplanets, has sparked a discussion, to what extent planetary protection should be extended to exoplanets. Gros argues that the extended timescales of interstellar missions imply that planetary and exoplanetary protection have different ethical groundings. ==See also== * * * * * ==References== ==General references== * * * * * * * ==External links== *No bugs please, this is a clean planet!

      "Electrophoresis[SEP]thumb|300px|1. Illustration of electrophoresis thumb|300px|2. Illustration of electrophoresis retardation Electrophoresis is the motion of dispersed particles relative to a fluid under the influence of a spatially uniform electric field. Electrophoresis of positively charged particles (cations) is sometimes called cataphoresis, while electrophoresis of negatively charged particles (anions) is sometimes called anaphoresis. The electrokinetic phenomenon of electrophoresis was observed for the first time in 1807 by Russian professors Peter Ivanovich Strakhov and Ferdinand Frederic Reuss at Moscow University, who noticed that the application of a constant electric field caused clay particles dispersed in water to migrate. It is ultimately caused by the presence of a charged interface between the particle surface and the surrounding fluid. It is the basis for analytical techniques used in chemistry for separating molecules by size, charge, or binding affinity. Electrophoresis is used in laboratories to separate macromolecules based on size. The technique applies a negative charge so proteins move towards a positive charge. Electrophoresis is used extensively in DNA, RNA and protein analysis. == History == == Theory == Suspended particles have an electric surface charge, strongly affected by surface adsorbed species, on which an external electric field exerts an electrostatic Coulomb force. According to the double layer theory, all surface charges in fluids are screened by a diffuse layer of ions, which has the same absolute charge but opposite sign with respect to that of the surface charge. The electric field also exerts a force on the ions in the diffuse layer which has direction opposite to that acting on the surface charge. This latter force is not actually applied to the particle, but to the ions in the diffuse layer located at some distance from the particle surface, and part of it is transferred all the way to the particle surface through viscous stress. This part of the force is also called electrophoretic retardation force, or ERF in short. When the electric field is applied and the charged particle to be analyzed is at steady movement through the diffuse layer, the total resulting force is zero : : F_{tot} = 0 = F_{el} + F_{f} + F_{ret} Considering the drag on the moving particles due to the viscosity of the dispersant, in the case of low Reynolds number and moderate electric field strength E, the drift velocity of a dispersed particle v is simply proportional to the applied field, which leaves the electrophoretic mobility μe defined as:Anodic Aqueous electrophoretic Deposition of Titanium Dioxide Using Carboxylic Acids as Dispersing Agents Journal of the European Ceramic Society, 31(6), 1041-1047, 2011 :\\mu_e = {v \\over E}. The most well known and widely used theory of electrophoresis was developed in 1903 by Smoluchowski: :\\mu_e = \\frac{\\varepsilon_r\\varepsilon_0\\zeta}{\\eta}, where εr is the dielectric constant of the dispersion medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (C² N−1 m−2), η is dynamic viscosity of the dispersion medium (Pa s), and ζ is zeta potential (i.e., the electrokinetic potential of the slipping plane in the double layer, units mV or V). The Smoluchowski theory is very powerful because it works for dispersed particles of any shape at any concentration. It has limitations on its validity. For instance, it does not include Debye length κ−1 (units m). However, Debye length must be important for electrophoresis, as follows immediately from Figure 2, \"Illustration of electrophoresis retardation\". Increasing thickness of the double layer (DL) leads to removing the point of retardation force further from the particle surface. The thicker the DL, the smaller the retardation force must be. Detailed theoretical analysis proved that the Smoluchowski theory is valid only for sufficiently thin DL, when particle radius a is much greater than the Debye length: : a \\kappa \\gg 1. This model of \"thin double layer\" offers tremendous simplifications not only for electrophoresis theory but for many other electrokinetic theories. This model is valid for most aqueous systems, where the Debye length is usually only a few nanometers. It only breaks for nano-colloids in solution with ionic strength close to water. The Smoluchowski theory also neglects the contributions from surface conductivity. This is expressed in modern theory as condition of small Dukhin number: : Du \\ll 1 In the effort of expanding the range of validity of electrophoretic theories, the opposite asymptotic case was considered, when Debye length is larger than particle radius: : a \\kappa < \\\\!\\, 1. Under this condition of a \"thick double layer\", Hückel predicted the following relation for electrophoretic mobility: :\\mu_e = \\frac{2\\varepsilon_r\\varepsilon_0\\zeta}{3\\eta}. This model can be useful for some nanoparticles and non-polar fluids, where Debye length is much larger than in the usual cases. There are several analytical theories that incorporate surface conductivity and eliminate the restriction of a small Dukhin number, pioneered by Overbeek. and Booth. Modern, rigorous theories valid for any Zeta potential and often any aκ stem mostly from Dukhin–Semenikhin theory.Dukhin, S.S. and Semenikhin N.V. \"Theory of double layer polarization and its effect on electrophoresis\", Koll.Zhur. USSR, volume 32, page 366, 1970. In the thin double layer limit, these theories confirm the numerical solution to the problem provided by O'Brien and White. For more modeling more complex scenarios, these simplifications become inaccurate, and the electric field must be modeled spatially, tracking it's magnitude and direction. Poisson's equation can be used to model this spatially-varying electric field. It's influence on fluid flow can be modeled with the Stokes Equation, while transport of different ions can be modeled using the Nernst–Planck equation. This combined approach is referred to as the Poisson- Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations. This approach has been validated the electrophoresis of particles. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * ==External links== * List of relative mobilities Category:Colloidal chemistry Category:Biochemical separation processes Category:Electroanalytical methods Category:Instrumental analysis Category:Laboratory techniques\n",

      "Coffee wastewater[SEP]Coffee wastewater, also known as coffee effluent, is a byproduct of coffee processing. Its treatment and disposal is an important environmental consideration for coffee processing as wastewater is a form of industrial water pollution. The unpicked fruit of the coffee tree, known as the coffee cherry, undergoes a long process to make it ready for consumption. This process often entails use of large quantities of water and the production of considerable amounts of solid and liquid waste. The type of waste is a result of the type of process that the coffee cherries go through. The conversion of the cherry to oroStemming from the Spanish word for gold, due to the colour of the dried bean or green bean (the dried coffee bean which is ready to be exported) is achieved through either a dry, semi-washed or fully washed process. == Processing == === Dry === The coffee cherries are dried immediately after they are harvested through sun drying, solar drying or artificial drying. In sun drying, the coffee cherries are placed on a clean floor and left to dry in the open air. In solar drying, the cherries are placed in a closed cabinet, which has ventilation holes to let moisture out. Artificial drying is used mostly during the wet season, when the low level of sunlight extends the time needed for solar drying and the cherries are prone to mold growth. After being dried, the cherries are hulled. In this process the dried outer layer of the cherry, known as the pericarp, is removed mechanically. === Semi-washed === In semi-washed processing, the cherries are de-pulped to remove the pericarp. After this the slimy mucilage layer which covers the bean is removed. This is done mechanically by feeding the beans into a cylindrical device which conveys them upward. While the friction and pressure exerted on the beans by this process is enough to remove most of the mucilage, a small amount of it will still remain in the centre-cut of the beans. This technique is used in Colombia and Mexico in order to reduce the water consumption from the long fermentation process and the extensive washing. ==== Becolsub ==== In order to reduce the contamination generated by the wet process of coffee fruits, scientists at Cenicafé developed a technology that avoids using water when not needed and uses the right water when needed. The technology, called Becolsub (taken from the initials of the Spanish for ecological wet coffee process with by-products handling: Beneficio Ecologicos Sub-productos), controls more than 90% of the contamination generated by its predecessor. The quality of the coffee processed this way is the same as for coffee processed by natural fermentation. The Becolsub technology consists of pulping without water, mechanical demucilaging and mixing the by-products (fruit outer-skin and mucilage) in a screw conveyor. The technology also includes a hydromechanical device to remove floating fruits and light impurities, as well as heavy and hard objects, and a cylindrical screen to remove the fruits whose skin was not separated in the pulping machine. Scientists at Cenicafé discovered that a coffee fruit with mucilage (immature and dry fruits have no mucilage) has enough water inside for the skin and seeds to be separated in conventional pulping machines without water, that the liquid was only required as a conveying means and that pulping without water avoids 72% of the potential contamination. Mucilage removal has been done through a fermenting process, which takes between 14 and 18 hours, until the mucilage is degraded and can easily be removed with water. Washing fermented mucilage requires, in the best case, 5.0 L/kg of DPC. Scientists at Cenicafé developed a machine to remove the mucilage covering the coffee seeds. This machine, called Deslim (the initial letters of the Spanish demucilager, the mechanical washer and cleaner) removes more than 98% of the total mucilage (same as a well conducted fermentation) by exerting stress and generating collisions among beans, using only 0.7 L/kg of DPC. The resulting highly concentrated mixture of water, mucilage and impurities is viscous and is added to the separated fruit skin in a screw conveyor. In the screw conveyor the retention is greater than 60%, which means a 20% additional control of potential contamination. The two by-products are widely used as worms' substrate to produce natural fertilizers. However, the high concentration of the mucilage obtained from the demucilager provides opportunity for industrializing the by-product. === Fully washed === This process is mainly used when processing Coffea arabica. After de-pulping, the beans are collected in fermentation tanks where bacterial removal of the mucilage takes place over 12 to 36 hours. The fermentation phase is important in the development of the flavour of the coffee, which is partially due to the microbiological processes that take place. The emergence of yeasts and moulds in acidic water can lead to off-flavors like sour coffee and onion-flavour. However, wet processing is believed to yield higher quality coffee than the other processes since small amounts of off-flavors give the coffee its particular taste and \"body\". When fermentation is complete, the beans are washed thoroughly to remove fermentation residues and any remaining mucilage. If not removed, these cause decolouring of the parchment and make the beans susceptible to yeasts. After washing, the beans are dried. When the drying process is not rapid enough earthy and musty taints, like Rio-flavor come up. == Water usage == The amount of water used in processing depends strongly on the type of processing. Wet fully washed processing of the coffee cherries requires the most fresh water, dry processing the least. Sources indicate a wide range in water use. Recycling of water in the de-pulping process can drastically reduce the amount needed. With reuse and improved washing techniques, up to 1 to 6 m3 water per tonne of fresh coffee cherry is achievable; without reuse a consumption of up to 20 m3/tonne is possible.

The main component is organic matter, stemming from de-pulping and mucilage removal. The majority of organic material in the wastewater is highly resistant and COD values, the amount oxygen required to stabilize organic matter by using a strong oxidant, make up 80% of the pollution load, with values as high as 50 g/L. The BOD, the amount of oxygen required for the biological decomposition of organic matter under aerobic conditions at a standardized temperature and time of incubation, coming from biodegradable organic material can reach values of 20 g/L. With a (rough) screening and removal of the pulp COD and BOD values become considerably lower. Values in the range of 3–5 g/L for COD and 1.5–3 g/L for BOD5BOD values after 5 days were found. Recorded values of 2.5 g/L for COD and 1.5 g/L for BOD5. A large part of the organic matter, pectins, precipitates as mucilated solids and could be taken out of the water. When these solids are not removed and pH values rise and an increase in COD can be observed. In order to optimize the anaerobic processing of the wastewater pH values should be between 6.5 and 7.5, instead of the generally present values of pH=4, which is highly acidic. This is obtained by adding calcium hydroxide (CaOH2) to the wastewater. This resulted in a regained solubility of the pectins, raising COD from an average of 3.7 g/L to an average of 12.7 g/L. The water is further characterised by the presence of flavonoid compounds, coming from the skin of the cherries. Flavonoid compounds result in dark colouration of the water at a pH=7 or higher, but they do not add to BOD or COD levels of the wastewater, nor have major environmental impacts. Lower levels of transparency, however, can have a negative impact on photosynthetic processes and growth and nutrient transformations by (especially) rooted water plants. Many efforts in olive and wine processing industries, with relatively large funds for research, have been trying to find a solution for this problem. Calvert mentions research done into the removal of polyphenolics and flavonoid compounds by species of wood digesting fungi (Basidiomycetes) in a submerged solution with aeration using compressed air. These complex processes seemed to be able to remove the colour compounds, but simplified, cheaper techniques using other types of fungi (i.e. Geotrichum, Penicillium, Aspergillus) only thrived in highly diluted wastewaters. Coffee wastewater is not a constant flow of water with uniform loadings of contamination. The processing of coffee cherries is a batch process and regarding water flows, two processes can be determined: de-pulping and fermentation/washing. === De-pulping === thumb|A mechanical separator de-pulps coffee cherries with the aid of water The water used for de-pulping of the cherries is referred to as pulping water. It accounts for just over half of the water used in the process. According to Von Enden and Calvert, \"pulping water consists of quickly fermenting sugars from both pulp and mucilage components. Pulp and mucilage consists to a large extent of proteins, sugars and the mucilage in particular of pectins, i.e. polysaccharide carbohydrates. These sugars are fermenting using the enzymes from the bacteria on the cherries. Other components in pulping water are acids and toxic chemicals like polyphenolics (tannins) or alkaloids (caffeine). Pulping water can be reused during the de-pulping of the harvest of one day. This results in an increase in organic matter and a decrease in pH. Research in Nicaragua showed COD averages rising from 5,400 mg/L up to 8,400 mg/L with most of the pulp removed. The drop in pH can be attributed to the start of fermentation of the pulping water. This drop continues until fermentation is finished and pH levels of around 4 are reached. The nutrient content of the pulping water at the maximum COD load, which was considered to reflect maximum pollution, was determined during this research. Total nitrogen (TN) concentration in the samples ranged from 50 to 110 mg/L with an average over all samples of 90 mg/L. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the samples ranged from 8.9 to 15.2 mg/L with an average over all samples of 12.4 mg/L. === Washing === Washing of the fermented beans leads to wastewater containing mainly pectins from the mucilage, proteins and sugars. The fermentation of the sugars (disaccharide carbohydrates) into ethanol and CO2 leads to acid conditions in the washing water. The ethanol is converted in acetic acids after reaction with oxygen, lowering the pH to levels of around 4. The high acidity can negatively affect the treatment efficiency of treatment facilities treating the coffee wastewater like an anaerobic reactor or constructed wetlands and is considered to be detrimental for aquatic life when discharged directly into surface waters. During the washing process the research in Nicaragua showed a clear decrease in contamination of the wastewater. The COD values drop from an average of 7,200 mg/L to less than 50 mg/L. Despite the fact that wastewater with COD values below 200 mg/L is allowed to be discharged in the natural waterways in Nicaragua it is advisable to redirect all the wastewater to the treatment system. This is because COD levels cannot be determined onsite during the washing process and discharge of the wastewater into surface waters is based on visual inspection. When the water is \"clear\" it is considered to be clean enough but the COD values measured during the research showed that discharge generally was to soon, resulting in wastewater with higher levels of COD than permitted. Another positive effect of diverting the wastewater to a treatment system is the dilution of the wastewater which enables better treatment by anaerobic bacteria due to more favourable pH values and better post-treatment due to lower concentrations of ammonium. TN concentration in the samples of wastewater stemming from washing ranged from 40 to 150 mg/L with an average over all samples of 110 mg/L. TP concentration in the samples ranged from 7.8 to 15.8 mg/L with an average over all samples of 10.7 mg/L. ==See also== == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * * Category:Coffee production Category:Waste\n",

      "Transmission of plant viruses[SEP]Transmission of plant viruses is the movement of plant viruses between organisms. ==Background== Viruses are known to infect both plant cells and animal cells. Since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites they must develop direct methods of transmission, between hosts, in order to survive. The mobility of animals increases the mechanisms of viral transmission that have evolved, whereas plants remain immobile, and thus plant viruses must rely on environmental factors to be transmitted between hosts. ==Natural transmission between plant hosts== The structural differences between plant and animal cells have resulted in a variety of transmission routes being exploited, enabling the virus to be passed between different host plants. The main difference, from the point of view of a virus, is the cell wall. This forms a tough barrier between the intracellular components and the extracellular environment, which has to be penetrated. These differences, combined with the fact that plants are immobile, have resulted in plant viruses relying on the wind and soil to transmit seeds as well as vectors. Vectors either transmit the virus propagative transmission, which results in an amplification of the virus by replication within the cells of the vector, or non-propagative transmission which simply carries the virus between the plants without viral replication. Common vectors include bacteria, fungi, nematodes, arthropods and arachnids. Furthermore, human intervention, including grafting and experimental mechanical damage, physically damages the cell wall, contributes to the array of transmission routes. The virus commonly uses these methods to be passed from one host to another. However, the virus is dependent upon physical damage, generated naturally by the wind and feeding of vectors or by human intervention. ==Transmission between plant cells== Viral infections often develop into systemic infections as a means of transmission. The virus often infects many tissues, if not the whole plant, where it can continue to replicate. There are a variety of methods the virus can use to spread throughout the organism but the most common route use the vascular system, otherwise known as the xylem and phloem, and the plasmodesmata, which interconnect adjacent cells. Nevertheless, the rigidity of the cell wall of plant cells, not only poses a problem for transmission of the viruses between different plant hosts, but also acts to prevent viral transmission between cells. Consequently, the virus must modify the plasmodesmata as they, themselves, are too large to fit through the small and tightly regulated plant structure. There are again a variety of mechanisms used for this, which have evolved for different viruses. The main mechanisms involve expressing proteins which coat the virus and interact with the structure of the plasmodesmata. The array of proteins expressed by the different viruses may act differently but all achieve a similar goal, passage between adjacent cells. ==External links== *MicrobiologyBytes: Plant viruses *Vectors of Plant Viruses *Descriptions of Plant Viruses Category:Virology\n",

      "Electrodiffusiophoresis[SEP]Electrodiffusiophoresis is a motion of particles dispersed in liquid induced by external homogeneous electric field, which makes it similar to electrophoresis. ==Overview== In contradistinction with electrophoresis, motion of particle in homogeneous electric field only, electrodiffusiophoresis occurs in the areas of the dispersion that experience concentration polarization due to, for instance, electrochemical reactions, see electrochemistry. There are concentration gradients in such areas that affect particles motion strongly. First of all they create inhomogeneity in the electric field. Secondly, they cause diffusiophoresis. This peculiarities of the particles motion in the areas subjected to the concentration polarization justifies introduction of the special term for this electrokinetic effect - electrodiffusiophoresis. One of the most important differences of the electrodiffusioporesis from the electrophoresis is that exists as directed particles drift in the alternating electric field. Electrophoresis, in contrary, causes only particles oscillation on the same spot. This difference opens opportunities for important applications. Electrodiffusiophoresis was theoretically predicted in 1980 - 82.Malkin, E.S., Dukhin, A.S., Kolloid Zh., vol.42, p.481 (1980).Malkin, E.S., Dukhin, A.S., Kolloid Zh., vol.44, p.254 (1982). It was experimentally observed microscopically in 1982.Ulberg, Z.R., Kuznetsova, E.S., Malkin, E.S., Dukhin, A.S., Kolloid Zh., vol.44, p.523 (1982). The first application of this effect was explanation of particles depositing at some distance from the surface of the ion selective membrane.Dukhin, A.S., Borkovskaya, Y.B. Ionoselective membranes, p.68 (1982). These earlier experiments and theory were described in the review published in 1990.Ulberg, Z.R., Dukhin, A.S., Progress in organic coatings, Elsevier, p.1-41(1990). This review presents also application of electrodiffusiophoresis for making bactericidal coatings. This effect has attracted new attention in 2010 with regard to microfluidics.Rica, R.A.; Bazant, M.Z.

      "Alan S. Kaufman[SEP]Alan S. Kaufman (born April 1944) is an American psychologist and writer known for his work on intelligence testing. == Early life and career == Born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island, Kaufman earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1965; M.A. in Educational Psychology from Columbia University in 1967; and Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1970 (under Robert L. Thorndike), specializing in psychometrics. He has been married to psychologist Nadeen L. Kaufman since 1964. While Assistant Director at The Psychological Corporation from 1968 to 1974, he worked closely with David Wechsler on the revision of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and supervised the standardization of the revised version (WISC-R). He also collaborated with Dorothea McCarthy in the development and standardization of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. He held positions at University of Georgia (1974–1979) and University of Alabama (1984–1995) before taking a position at Yale University. Both have been at Yale University's Child Study Center in the School of Medicine since 1997. == Development of Kaufman IQ scales == The research team that Kaufman and his wife supervised while at the University of Georgia in 1978-79 developed the original Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) and several other psychological and educational tests, including the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (K-TEA/NU), Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT), and the second editions of both ( KTEA-II and KBIT-2). The Kaufman Survey of Early Academic and Language Skills (K-SEALS) and the Cognitive/Language Profile of the Early Screening Profiles address the preschool level. The Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test (KAIT), the Kaufman Short Neuropsychological Assessment Procedure (K-SNAP), and the Kaufman Functional Academic Skills Test (K-FAST) extend through the adult life span.Boffey, Philip M. (August 25, 1982). New tests for children hailed as gain in assessing intellect. The New York Times In 2004/2005, revised versions of the Kaufmans' tests were published, including the KABC-II, KTEA-II, and KBIT-2. The KABC-II integrates both the PASS and CHC theories of intelligence. == Overview of Kaufman's tests== Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT) The Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT) is a brief, individually administered measure of verbal (vocabulary subtest) and non verbal (Matrices subtest) intelligence. It can be used with those aged 4–90 years old and takes between 15–30 minutes to administer. It can be useful in a variety of settings including clinical, educational, vocational, and research settings. The original KBIT was published in 1990, while the second edition (KBIT-2) followed in 2004. The KBIT-2 generates three scores: Verbal, Non Verbal and an overall IQ composite. Theoretically the verbal subtests measure crystallised ability and the non verbal subtests measure fluid reasoning. The Verbal portion of the KBIT-2 is made up of two subtests, Verbal Knowledge and Riddles. These measure verbal, school related skills by measuring an individual's word knowledge, verbal concept formation, reasoning ability and range of general information. The Non Verbal portion is made up of the Matrices subtest and measures the ability to solve new problems by assessing ability to perceive relationships and complete visual analogies. Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (KTEA) The KTEA provides an individually administered measure of educational achievement for those aged 4 years 6 months – 25 years (comprehensive form) and 4 years 6 months – 90+ (brief form). The test can be used to identify an individual's strengths and weaknesses in three key domains: maths, written language and spoken language. It can also be used as part of a comprehensive psychological, psychoeducational or neuropsychological test battery which can enhance understanding of the individuals total functioning. The current edition was published in 2004. Since its publication it has become a widely used measure of academic achievement in education. The test takes between 15–80 minutes to administer and there are two alternate forms which enables it to be used to monitor progress or response to intervention. The Comprehensive Form consists of 14 subtests grouped into 4 domain composites, 4 reading-related composites, an overall Comprehensive Achievement Composite in addition to separate subtest scores. The Brief Form is a curriculum-based instrument which provides norm- referenced assessment in the same three core achievement domains as the comprehensive form. There is no content overlap with the Comprehensive Form, it can be used for retesting and includes the following subtests: * Reading — word recognition and reading comprehension * Maths — computation and application problems * Written expression — written language and spelling. The Brief Form provides a battery composite as well as subtest scores in reading, maths and spelling. == Influence on other researchers == Widely regarded as a teacher and mentor, as well as a researcher, Kaufman's cadre of doctoral students at the University of Georgia has gone on to become a significant influence in the field as well. Kaufman mentored, among others, Cecil R. Reynolds, Randy W. Kamphaus, Bruce Bracken, Steve McCallum, Jack A. Naglieri, and Patti Harrison, all of whom became Professors at major universities and authors of some of the most widely used psychological tests in the United States. Also Kaufman with his wife, Nadeen, supervised foreign doctoral students at the University of Alabama including Toshinori Ishikuma and Soo- Back Moon, who became influential Professors in mother countries and translated and adopted the K-ABC for Japanese and Korean children, respectively. == Publications == * * * * * == Children == His son is a professor and researcher in psychology (creativity): James C.

      "The Proteus Operation[SEP]The Proteus Operation is a science fiction alternate history novel written by James P. Hogan. The plot focuses on an Anglo-American team of soldiers and civilians sent back in time from the Nazi-dominated world of 1975 to prevent an Axis victory in World War II that was engineered by more advanced time travelers from the 21st century. Historical figures in the book include Isaac Asimov, Wilhelm Canaris, Winston Churchill, Duff Cooper, Anthony Eden, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Reinhard Heydrich, Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, John F. Kennedy, Frederick Lindemann, George Pegram, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Leo Szilard, and Edward Teller. Of these, only Asimov and Teller were still alive when the novel was published in 1985. ==Plot== Originally, the First World War was a complete wake-up call for the human race, leading to greater internationalism and a \"Never Again\" spirit towards war that would eventually wear away the differences between the various power-blocs. By the 2020s, a global League of Nations oversees a planet totally at peace. The fledgling Nazi Party, in this 'original' timeline, simply faded out after the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. Many in the modern aristocracy, corporate dynasties, and others feel they have lost out because of the social transformations enabled by decades of peace and co-operation. This group come up with a plan to build a functional \"time machine\" and change history for their benefit. Their scheme is to go back as far as they can (roughly a century, to the very early 1920s) and mentor the fledgling Nazi Party. They regard the Nazis as the perfect tool for destroying the Soviet Union and establishing an elitist tyranny with which they can live the lives of luxury and entitlement they believe have been stolen from them. This 'Uptime' initiative sends 21st century advisors, armament, and nuclear weapons to support Adolf Hitler. The Hitler that they seek to advise soon develops other plans. Learning about the original history from his time traveling advisors, Hitler uses these lessons to ensure that Western Europe falls swiftly, followed by dropping a few of the Uptime nuclear weapons to wipe out the Soviet Union. He then destroys his end of the \"time conduit\" and declares independence from his former sponsors. By the 1970s, Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan have conquered everything other than North America, Australasia, and parts of South America. Africa has suffered an enormous genocide every bit as complete as the one inflicted upon the Jews, and the Axis powers stand poised in 1975 to start a final war that the United States is bound to lose, given the military power of Nazi Germany. An organization in this altered 1975 discovers the secret behind the Nazi successes of the previous decades. The group decides that it will build its own time machine to go back and stop the present nightmare of Nazi world domination. This 1975 time machine is not as advanced or powerful as the original 2020s machine, so they can only open a gate to 1939. The plan is to establish a military alliance between the 1975 America of President John F. Kennedy and the 1939 America of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The team starts noticing that events they had no hand in are different (such as the Joe Louis versus John Henry Lewis fight and the death of Pope Pius XI) and with Einstein's help realize that all possible outcomes already exist and all time travel does is take you to one of these other branches. Realizing why things have gone wrong, it is up to the 1975 Uptime agents, cut off in 1939, to keep the western Allies, including the United Kingdom and the United States in the fight, while working to close off Hitler's gateway to the alternate 2020s before he gets his atomic bomb and missile advantage. In the end, they succeed, and this second \"alternate timeline\" they create turns out to be our own world. They also realize that the United States of their own time knew they couldn't really change their present and was in reality planning to escape to the reality they would create just as the people backing Hitler had planned to do. To prevent their United States or Nazi Germany from invading our world they have the gate destroyed. ==See also== * Axis victory in World War II (an extensive list of other Wikipedia articles regarding works of Nazi Germany/Axis/World War II alternate history) ==References== ==External links== *The Proteus Operation at the author's official website Category:1985 British novels Category:1985 science fiction novels Category:British science fiction novels Category:Novels about time travel Category:Alternate Nazi Germany novels Category:Bantam Spectra books\n",

      "Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration[SEP]The main event by far shaping the foreign policy of the United States during the presidency of George W. Bush (2001–2009) was the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent war on terror. There was massive domestic and international support for destroying the attackers. With UN approval, US and NATO forces quickly invaded the attackers' base in Afghanistan and drove them out and the Taliban government that harbored them. It was the start of a 20-year quagmire that finally ended in failure with the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan. Other interactions with foreign nations during this period included diplomatic and military initiatives in the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere. Important economic developments that occurred during Bush's presidency include the several free-trade agreements. The chief advisors of the president were Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, and Vice President Dick Cheney. ==Appointments== George W. Bush administration foreign policy personnel Vice President Cheney (2001–2009) Secretary of State Powell (2001–2005) Rice (2005–2009) Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld (2001–2006) Gates (2006–2009) Ambassador to the United Nations Cunningham (2001) Negroponte (2001–2004) Danforth (2004–2005) Patterson (2005) Bolton (2005–2006) Wolff (2006–2007) Khalilzad (2007–2009) Director of Central Intelligence Tenet (2001–2004) McLaughlin (2004) Goss (2004–2005) Discontinued (2005–2009) Director of National Intelligence Not yet created (2001–2005) Negroponte (2005–2007) McConnell (2007–2009) Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Not yet created (2001–2005) Goss (2005–2006) Hayden (2006–2009) Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Rice (2001–2005) Hadley (2005–2009) Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Hadley (2001–2005) Crouch (2005–2007) Jeffrey (2007–2008) Trade Representative Zoellick (2001–2005) Allgeier (2005) Sapiro (2005–2006) Schwab (2006–2009) ==Approaching foreign policy== George W. Bush had little experience or interest in foreign policy prior to the presidency and his decisions were guided by his advisers. In a gaffe in 2000, for example, Bush confused Afghanistan's ruling Taliban with a musical band. Bush embraced the views of Cheney and other neoconservatives, who de-emphasized the importance of multilateralism; neoconservatives believed that because the United States was the world's lone superpower, it could act unilaterally if necessary.Smith (2016), pp. 181–182, 193 At the same time, Bush sought to enact the less interventionist foreign policy he had promised during the 2000 campaign.Draper (2007), pp. 128–130 Also during the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush's foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin America, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in \"nation-building\" and other small-scale military engagements. Oliver argues that Bush was quickly influenced by ideologues who argued for unilateral action to establish US primacy in world affairs. They included Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, – with Secretary of State Colin Powell as a non-ideological centrist.James Oliver, \"Pragmatic Fathers and Ideological Suns: Foreign Policy in the Administrations of George H.W. Bush and George W Bush\". White House Studies 7#3 (2007): 199–213.Roberta Haar, \"Explaining George W. Bush's adoption of the neoconservative agenda after 9/11\". Politics & Policy 38.5 (2010): 965–990. ===September 11 attacks=== On September 11, 2001, two hijacked planes destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City, a third plane hit the Pentagon and a fourth crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after being averted by passengers from its target. These attacks were carried out by the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization led by mastermind Osama Bin Laden On September 14, 2001, Congress passed legislation titled Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which was signed on September 18, 2001, by President Bush. It authorized the use of US Armed Forces against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks and those who harbored them. The September 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in Bush's presidency. That evening, he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, promising a strong response to the attacks. He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims. Three days after the attacks, Bush visited Ground Zero and met with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, firefighters, police officers, and volunteers. To much applause, Bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing in a heap of rubble: \"I can hear you. The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.\" In a September 20, 2001, address to congress, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to \"hand over the terrorists, or... share in their fate\". Writing about changes to the US State Department in the wake of the September 11 attacks in a 2020 article in Foreign Affairs magazine, former Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns and former Assistant Secretary of State Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, \"Although the transformation of the State Department into a more expeditionary and agile institution was healthy in many respects, it was also distorting. It was tethered to a fundamentally flawed strategy—one that was too narrowly focused on terrorism and too wrapped up in magical thinking about the United States' supposed power to transform regions and societies.\" ===Bush Doctrine=== After the September 11 attacks, Bush's approval ratings increased tremendously. Bush decided to use his newfound political capital to fundamentally change U.S. foreign policy. He became increasingly focused on the possibility of a hostile country providing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) to terrorist organizations.Draper (2007), pp. 166–169 During his early 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush set forth what has become known as the Bush Doctrine, which held that the United States would implement a policy of preemptive military strikes against nations known to be harboring or aiding a terrorist organization hostile to the United States.Smith (2016), pp. 277–278 Bush outlined what he called the \"Axis of Evil\", consisting of three nations that, he argued, posed the greatest threat to world peace due to their pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and potential to aid terrorists. The axis consisted of Iraq, North Korea and Iran.Herring (2008), pp. 943–944 Bush also began emphasizing the importance of spreading democracy worldwide, stating in 2005 that \"the survival of liberty in our land depends on the success of liberty in other land.\" Pursuant to this newly-interventionist policy, the Bush administration boosted foreign aid and increased defense expenditures.Leffler (2011), pp. 34–35 Defense spending rose from $304 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $616 billion in fiscal year 2008.Leffler (2011), pp. 37–38 ===National missile defense=== On December 13, 2001, President Bush announced the withdrawal of the United States from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a bedrock of U.S.–Soviet nuclear stability during the Cold War era. Bush stated, \"I have concluded the ABM treaty hinders our government's ability to develop ways to protect our people from future terrorist or rogue state missile attacks.\" According to the announcement, the withdrawal was to become effective six months from that date. The Bush administration pursued a national missile defense. The national missile defense project that Clinton introduced and Bush supported was designed to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles and destroy them in flight. Critics doubted that the project could ever work and said that it would cost US$53 billion from 2004 to 2009, being the largest single line item in the Pentagon's funding.Stephen L.

Online ==Other issues== ===Environmental issues=== In terms of international environmental policy, Daynes, and Sussman argues the son was less committed than the father, and neither was as successful as Bill Clinton.Byron W. Daynes, and Glen Sussman. \"Comparing the Environmental Policies of Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush\". White House Studies 7#3 (2007): 167+. Many governments have criticized the failure of the United States to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which was signed but not submitted for Senate ratification by the previous administration. Former President Bill Clinton recommended that his successor not submit the treaty for ratification until the wording was altered to reflect U.S. concerns. Bush, who was opposed to the treaty, rescinded U.S. executive approval from the proposed treaty. In 1997, prior to the Kyoto negotiations, the Byrd–Hagel Resolution passed in the U.S. Senate by a 95–0 vote. The resolution stated that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing nations as well as industrialized ones, or that seriously harm the American economy. Byron W. Daynes, and Glen Sussman conclude that Bush's policy had a \"negative impact on the environment\".Byron W. Daynes, and Glen Sussman, White House Politics and the Environment: Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush (Texas A&M; UP, 2010) pp 189–209. ===International Criminal Court=== thumb|right|400px|World map of ICC member states as of 2007 The International Criminal Court (ICC) came into being on July 1, 2002. The ICC is the first ever permanent, treaty based, international criminal court established to promote the rule of law and ensure that the gravest international crimes do not go unpunished. Later that year, in August 2002, the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) was passed by Congress with the stated intention \"to protect United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not a party.\" ==International trips== thumb|Countries visited by President Bush during his time in office The number of visits per country where he travelled are: * One visit to Albania, Argentina, Austria, Bahrain, Benin, Botswana, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Kosovo, Kuwait, Liberia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Rwanda, Senegal, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Vietnam, and the West Bank * Two visits to Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Jordan, Latvia, Peru, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia, and Thailand * Three visits to Egypt, South Korea, and Poland * Four visits to Canada, China, France, Iraq, and Japan * Five visits to Germany, the United Kingdom, and Vatican City * Six visits to Italy and Mexico * Seven visits to Russia ==International trade== Bush supported free trade policies and legislation but resorted to protectionist policies on occasion. Tariffs on imported steel imposed by the White House in March 2002 were lifted after the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled them illegal. Bush explained that the safeguard measures had \"achieved their purpose\", and \"as a result of changed economic circumstances\", it was time to lift them. Bush used the authority he gained from the Trade Act of 2002 to push through bilateral trade agreements with several countries. Bush also sought to expand multilateral trade agreements through the WTO, but negotiations were stalled in the Doha Development Round for most of Bush's presidency. On August 31, 2004, WTO arbitrators authorized the European Union and other leading U.S. trade partners to impose economic sanctions against the United States for violation of global trade laws. The decision by the WTO was one of several cases where the U.S. was found to have been in breach of international trade rules. However, Bush pursued and signed free trade agreements with several countries, including Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Morocco, Oman, Peru, Singapore, Jordan, Ukraine, and with six countries under the Central American Free Trade Agreement. ==Defense== ===Weapons of mass destruction=== The Bush administration released its \"National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction\" in December 2002. The strategy includes three key elements: counterproliferation to combat the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), strengthened nonproliferation to combat WMD proliferation, and consequence management to respond to WMD use. The classified version of this strategy reportedly reserved the right to use overwhelming force, including potentially nuclear weapons, in response to a WMD attack against the United States, its forces or allies. In February 2004, in the context of recent revelations about clandestine nuclear programs in Iran and Libya, and the role of the A. Q. Khan network in proliferation of sensitive nuclear technology, Bush proposed seven initiatives: # Cooperation on law enforcement for interdiction of WMD trade, known as the Proliferation Security Initiative; # Passage of a UN Security Council Resolution requiring states to enact WMD- related controls, which led to UN Security Council Resolution 1540; # Expansion of the G8 Global Partnership to eliminate WMD and secure WMD materials worldwide; # Reliable access to nuclear fuel, accompanied by a ban on transfers of enrichment and reprocessing technology to countries that do not already have such facilities; # Making the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Additional Protocol a condition for nuclear supply, and ratification of the U.S. Additional Protocol; # Establishing a Special Committee of the IAEA Board of Governors on safeguards and verification to strengthen compliance and enforcement; and # Excluding countries under investigation for nonproliferation violations from serving on the Board or the Special Committee. ===Defense spending=== Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about $450 billion was planned to be spent on defense. This level was generally comparable to the defense spending during the Cold War. Congress approved $87 billion for U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan in November, and had approved an earlier $79 billion package the previous spring. Most of the funds were for military operations in the two countries. The ratio of defense spending of the U.S. and its allies to its potential adversaries, for the year 2000, was about 6 to 1. ==International organizations== In July 2002, Bush cut off all funding, approximately $34 million, for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). This funding had been allocated by Congress the previous December. Bush claimed that the UNFPA supported forced abortions and sterilizations in China. His justification came from a group of members of Congress who oppose abortion and an anti-abortion organization called the Population Research Institute, which claimed to have obtained first-hand video taped evidence from victims of forced abortion and forced sterilization in counties where the UNFPA operates in China. This accusation has never been supported by any investigation, and has in fact been disproved by the US State Department, UK, and UN teams sent to examine UNFPA activities in China. The UNFPA points out that it \"does not provide support for abortion services\". Its charter includes a strong statement condemning coercion.\" The Bush administration opposed the creation of the United Nations Human Rights Council to protest the repressive states among its membership. ===UN peacekeeping=== In the United States, the Clinton and Bush administrations started from opposite perspectives but came to adopt remarkably similar policies in support of peace operations as tools for American foreign policy. Initial positions formed by ideological concerns, were replaced by pragmatic decisions about how to support UN peace operations. Both administrations were reluctant to contribute large contingents of ground troops to UN-commanded operations, even as both administrations supported increases in the number and scale of UN missions.Victoria K. Holt, and Michael G. Mackinnon. \"The origins and evolution of US policy towards peace operations\". International Peacekeeping 15.1 (2008): 18-34 online. The Clinton administration faced significant operational challenges. Instead of a liability, this was the tactical price of strategic success. American peace operations help transform its NATO alliance. The Bush administration started with a negative ideological attitude toward peace operations. However European and Latin American governments emphasized peace operations as strategically positive, especially regarding the use of European forces in Afghanistan and Lebanon. However American allies sometimes needed to flout their autonomy, even to the point of sacrificing operational efficiency, much to the annoyance of Washington.Richard Gowan, \"The United States and Peacekeeping Policy in Europe and Latin America: An Uncertain Catalyst?.\" International Peacekeeping 15.1 (2008): 84-101.Erika N. Cornelius, and Ryan C. Hendrickson, \"George W. Bush, War Powers and UN Peacekeeping in Haiti.\" White House Studies 8.1 (2008): 57+. ==Foreign aid== On July 21, 2004, in a statement on the fiftieth anniversary of the Food for Peace program, Bush hailed the United States for feeding the hungry. Noting that \"Millions are facing great affliction\", he stated that \"America has a special calling to come to their aid.\" After the 2004 election, however, the Bush administration told several private charities that it would not be honoring previous funding commitments. The shortfall, estimated at $100 million, forced the charities to suspend or eliminate programs that had already been approved to improve farming, education and health in order to promote self-sufficiency in poor countries. While the United States continued to give large amounts of aid abroad, the Bush presidency was criticized for having a major impact upon the Millennium Development Goals project of the United Nations. Many nations, including key OECD members, were criticized for falling far short of their promise to give 0.7% of their GDP in order to drastically reduce poverty by the target date of 2015. In his State of the Union Address in January 2003, Bush outlined a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief. The emergency relief effort was led by U.S. Ambassador Randall L. Tobias, former CEO of Eli Lilly and Global AIDS Coordinator at the Department of State. At the time of the speech, $9 billion was earmarked for new programs in AIDS relief for the 15 countries most affected by HIV/AIDS, another $5 billion for continuing support of AIDS relief in 100 countries where the U.S. already had bilateral programs established, and an additional $1 billion towards the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. This budget represented more money contributed to fight AIDS globally than all other donor countries combined. As the largest national economy in the world, the United States' leadership and commitment was seen as vital in addressing world poverty and ensuring implementation of the project, considered the most progressive and feasible to date for the United Nations or any other institution. President Bush signed a multimillion- dollar aid deal with the government of Tanzania on February 17, 2008. Bush, cheering Liberians to rebound from Second Liberian Civil War that left their nation in ruins, said February 21, 2008, that the United States will keep lending a hand to make Liberia a symbol of liberty for Africa and the world. President Bush ordered the release of $200 million in emergency aid to help countries in Africa and elsewhere. Riots from Haiti to Bangladesh to Egypt over surging food prices catapulted the issue to the forefront of the world's attention. ==Criticisms and defenses== The Bush policies in the Middle East, especially Iraq, have come under intense criticism although there are some supporters as well. Bush supporters point to a range of more successful policies elsewhere in the world, as summarized by Hal Brands and Peter Feaver: ==Americas== thumb|left|250px|Mexican President Fox, U.S. President Bush, and Canadian Prime Minister Martin ===Canada=== Canada's elite JTF2 unit joined American special forces in the U.S.-led coalition War in Afghanistan shortly after the al-Qaida attacks on September 11, 2001. Canadian forces joined the multinational coalition in Operation Anaconda in January 2002. On April 18, 2002, an American pilot bombed Canadian forces involved in a training exercise, killing four and wounding eight Canadians. A joint American-Canadian inquiry determined the cause of the incident to be pilot error, in which the pilot interpreted ground fire as an attack; the pilot ignored orders that he felt were \"second-guessing\" his field tactical decision. Canadian forces assumed a six-month command rotation of the International Security Assistance Force in 2003; in 2005, Canadians assumed operational command of the multi- national Brigade in Kandahar, with 2,300 troops, and supervises the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Kandahar, where al-Qaida forces are most active. Relations between Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and Bush were strained throughout their overlapping times in office. After the September 11 attacks terror attacks, Jean Chrétien publicly mused that U.S. foreign policy might be part of the \"root causes\" of terrorism. Some Americans criticized his \"smug moralism\", and Chrétien's public refusal to support the 2003 Iraq war was met with negative responses in the United States, especially among conservatives. Prime Minister Chrétien said on October 10, 2002, that Canada would, in fact, be part of a military coalition to invade Iraq if it were sanctioned by the United Nations. However, when the United States and the United Kingdom subsequently withdrew their diplomatic efforts to gain that UN sanction, Jean Chrétien announced in Parliament on June 18, 2003, that Canada would not participate in the pending invasion. Nevertheless, he offered the US and its soldiers his moral support. However, according to classified U.S. documents released by WikiLeaks, a high-ranking Canadian official may have secretly promised to clandestinely support the invasion. Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Bush were thought to share warm personal relations and also close ties between their administrations. Because Bush was so unpopular among liberals in Canada (particularly in the media), this was underplayed by the Harper government. Shortly after being congratulated by Bush for his victory in February 2006, Harper rebuked U.S. ambassador to Canada David Wilkins for criticizing the Conservatives' plans to assert Canada's sovereignty over the Arctic Ocean waters with military force. ===Central American Free Trade Agreement=== The U.S. Senate approved the CAFTA-DR on June 30, 2005, by a vote of 54–45, and the U.S. House of Representatives approved the pact on July 28, 2005, by a vote of 217–215, with two representatives not voting. Controversy arose over this vote because it was held open 1 hour and 45 minutes longer than the normal 15 minutes in order to get some members to change their votes. For procedural reasons, the Senate took a second vote on CAFTA on July 28 and the pact garnered an additional vote from Sen. Joe Lieberman—who had been absent on June 30—in favor of the agreement. The implementing legislation became Public Law 109-053 when it was signed by Bush on August 2, 2005. The Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras have also approved the agreement. They are all the current members of CAFTA-DR. El Salvador became the first country to formally implement CAFTA, which went into effect on March 1, 2006, when the Organization of American States (OAS) received signed copies of the treaty. On April 1, 2006, Honduras and Nicaragua fully implemented the agreement. On May 18, 2006, the Congress of Guatemala ratified CAFTA-DR, which went into effect on July 1, 2006. The Dominican Republic implemented the agreement on March 1, 2007. In a referendum on October 7, 2007, Costa Rica narrowly backed the free trade agreement, with 51.6% voting \"Yes\"; the agreement took effect on January 1, 2009. ===Chile=== President Bush signed the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement signed on June 6, 2003. The pact came into force on January 1, 2004. On that date, tariffs on 90% of U.S. exports to Chile and 95% of Chilean exports to the United States were eliminated. The agreement also established that Chile and the U.S. will establish duty-free trade in all products within a maximum of 12 years (2016).http://www.ustr.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/reports/2010/NTE/2010_NTE_Chile_final.pdf In 2009, bilateral trade between the United States and Chile reached US$15.4 billion, a 141% increase over bilateral trade levels before the U.S.-Chile FTA took effect. In particular, U.S. exports to Chile in 2009 showed a 248% increase over pre-FTA levels. ===Mexico=== 250px|thumb|left|Vicente Fox, president of Mexico with Bush During Fox's administration, Mexico pushed for \"comprehensive\" reform of U.S. immigration law that addressed the problem of Illegal immigration to the United States. The issue had been called \"The Whole Enchilada\" by Fox's administration, which stated that \"immigration reform in the United States should address mutual border problems, the rights of undocumented immigrants, and the development of regions in Mexico that 'expel' migrants\". However, according to former U.S. ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow, all discussions between the parties on immigration were informal. The immigration reform that Fox sought included a guest worker plan. Fox said, \"The best thing that can happen to both our countries is to have an orderly flow, a controlled flow, of migration to the United States\". This reform was supported by President Bush and approved by the U.S. Senate, however, the bill was rejected by the House of Representatives. According to the Washington Post, the hopes were complicated by the recent approval of the SBI (Secure Border Initiative), a bill that includes building a triple fence between the U.S. and Mexico. With Senate Vote, Congress Passes Border Fence Bill; Barrier Trumps Immigration Overhaul During Fox's presidency the net migration rate in Mexico increased 152% from −2.84 migrants per 1,000 inhabitants to −4.32; Mexico, The CIA factbook. in the same period, population growth decreased 35% from 1.57%Globalis – an interactive world map – Mexico – Annual population growth rate to 1.16%. Fox, who was said to be \"proud\" of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. has acknowledged the importance of remittances by both legal and illegal Mexican workers in the U.S. (now the #1 source of revenue for the country). During the country's tenure as a rotating member of the UN Security Council, Mexico did not support the U.S-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, ===Peru=== On November 18, 2003, the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, notified Congress of the intention of the Bush administration to initiate negotiations for a free trade agreement with the countries involved in the Andean trade act.Office of the United States Trade Representative, USTR Notifies Congress of Intent to Initiate Free Trade Talks with Andean Countries . November 18, 2003. Retrieved on December 4, 2007. Negotiations started without Bolivia in May 2004, however, as each of the three remaining Andean countries decided to pursue bilateral agreements with the United States. After 13 rounds of negotiations, Peru and the United States concluded an agreement on December 7, 2005. Alfredo Ferrero, Peruvian Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, and the U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman signed the deal on April 12, 2006, in Washington, D.C., in the presence of Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo. The Congress of Peru debated the agreement for six hours during the night of June 27, 2006, and ratified it in the early hours of the next day. The vote was 79–14, with seven abstentions.

The implementation bills gained wide support from the Republican Party (176–16 in the House, 47–1 in the Senate) and split backing from the Democratic Party (109–116 and 29–17). On January 16, 2009, Bush signed a proclamation To Implement the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement and for Other Purposes, effective February 1, 2009. ==Asia== ===ASEAN=== President Bush simultaneously improved relations with India, Japan, South Korea, China and ASEAN. Bush confirmed that he would be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) conference for the first time during his presidency in 2007. However, he did not attend the conference due to American opposition to the government of Myanmar at the time. The Straits Times. ===China=== The Bush administration's policy towards China faced the difficult task of sustaining the cooperative US-China relationship in the context of China's rise. China's success in economic development since the 1979 reforms had allowed Beijing to transform growing Chinese material wealth into political and military power. Robert Zoellick, serving in Bush's cabinet as US Trade Representative and Deputy Secretary of State, once underlined that \"China is big, it is growing, and it will influence the world in the years ahead. At the end of his second term, President Bush had successfully managed to establish significant elements of US-China cooperation and build a record of cooperation with a rising China while achieving US national interests. During his presidential campaign, Bush revealed his disagreement with the Clinton administration's view of China as \"a competitor, not a strategic partner. While seeing China as a power in transition and asserting that if China became a friend of the US, \"that friendship will steady the world. But if not, the peace we seek may not be found\", Bush warned that China would be \"respected as a great power... unthreatened, but not unchecked\", under his administration. Bush became increasingly concerned about China's growing economic and political influence in the world, often labelled as 'China's rise', and its implications for US primacy and interests. President Bush believed that China's rise was an inevitable phenomenon that the United States had to manage. He strived to build a \"constructive, candid, and cooperative\" relationship with China. This, in Bush's viewpoint, would form a sturdy basis for the US to advance engagement with China. In fact, Bush's determination to increase cooperation with China led to \"the best relations since 1972. The Bush administration had made efforts to embed the Chinese economy in the international economic system, assist Chinese economic development and share the mutual economic benefits between the two nations. In 2001, despite a confrontation between Washington and Beijing over the downed EP-3E Aries II spy plane which collided with a Chinese fighter jet, President Bush still declared his support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. He said, \"I'm an advocate of China's entry into the WTO\", stressing that \"China ought to be a trading partner of ours. I think it is in our economic interests to open up the Chinese markets to U.S. products, to U.S. agricultural products\". Also, President Bush actively supported permanent normalized trade relations with China. In his view, American farmers and businessmen would gain better benefits from freer access to the large Chinese market. He therefore asked the US Congress to extend normalized trade relations with China in 2001: \"Fair trade is essential not only to improving living standards for Americans but also for a strong and productive relationship with China.\" President Bush and his team believed that trading with China would be a good thing for the US and Chinese economies. Integrating China into the world economy would ultimately lead to the promotion of human dignity in China and the emergence of a good China. In her 2000 article entitled \"Promoting the National Interest\" Condoleezza Rice, Bush's Secretary of State, wrote: President Bush's efforts to build a cooperative relationship with China can also be seen in his way of maintaining frank and productive relations with Chinese leaders. In 2002–2003 the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) broke out in China. There were up to 5,327 infections and 348 deaths in China. While the Chinese leadership had been criticized for its handling of the SARS outbreak, President Bush praised his Chinese counterpart for being open about this transnational epidemic. President Bush's public support for President Hu in that critical moment was highly appreciated by the Chinese president and contributed to building cooperative leader-to-leader relations between the United States and China. President Bush called Chinese President Hu Jintao March 26, 2008, to express his concern about China's crackdown on protesters in Tibet since March 10, 2008. Bush and Hu also discussed issues including Taiwan, North Korea's denuclearization and Myanmar. ===India=== thumb|right|President GBush shakes hands with India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his visit to India in 2006, at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi Relations with India improved significantly during Bush's tenure. In September 2001, President Bush removed sanctions which had been imposed. During the tenure of the George W. Bush administration, relations between India and the United States were seen to have blossomed, primarily over common concerns regarding growing Islamic extremism, energy security, and climate change. Bush commented, \"India is a great example of democracy. It is very devout, has diverse religious heads, but everyone is comfortable about their religion. The world needs India\".The world needs India: Bush March 3, 2006 Fareed Zakaria, in his book The Post- American World, described Bush as \"being the most pro-Indian president in American history.\"Zakaria, Fareed, The Post-American World, 2008 Cahapter VII, pp. 225–226 Similar sentiments are echoed by Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy and ideologue of India's Congress Party – the largest constituent of the UPA. According to Laskar, the UPA rule has seen a \"transformation in bilateral ties with the US\", as a result of which the relations now covers \"a wide range of issues, including high technology, space, education, agriculture, trade, clean energy, counter-terrorism, etc.\". After the December 2004 tsunami, the US and Indian navies cooperated in search and rescue operations and in the reconstruction of affected areas. Since 2004, Washington and New Delhi have been pursuing a \"strategic partnership\" that is based on shared values and generally convergent geopolitical interests. Numerous economic, security, and global initiatives – including plans for civilian nuclear cooperation – are underway. This latter initiative, first launched in 2005, reversed three decades of American non-proliferation policy. Also in 2005, the United States and India signed a ten-year defence framework agreement, with the goal of expanding bilateral security cooperation. The two countries engaged in numerous and unprecedented combined military exercises, and major US arms sales to India were concluded. An Open Skies Agreement was signed in April 2005, enhancing trade, tourism, and business via the increased number of flights, and Air India purchased 68 US Boeing aircraft at a cost of $8 billion. The United States and India also signed a bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation in 2005. After Hurricane Katrina, India donated $5 million to the American Red Cross and sent two planeloads of relief supplies and materials to help. Then, on March 1, 2006, President Bush made another diplomatic visit to further expand relations between India and the U.S. ===Japan=== thumb|Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi and President Bush meet at the White House on September 25, 2001 During Bush's visit to Japan, In his address to the Japanese parliament in February 2002, President Bush expressed his gratitude to Japan for supporting the US in the war on terror, and asserting that the Japanese response to the terrorist threat showed the strength of the US-Japan alliance and \"the indispensable role of Japan, a role that is global, and begins in Asia\". President Bush also convinced members of Japan's parliament that the 21st century would be \"the Pacific century\", and committed to giving support to Japan. The Bush administration made important progress in deepening US-Japan security cooperation. Under Bush, bilateral security initiatives between the United States and Japan were centred on counter-terrorism cooperation. President Bush endorsed the idea that Japan should play a more active international role and praised Japan for its passage of the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law that allowed Japan to send refuelling tankers to the Indian Ocean to assist US-led operations in Afghanistan in 2001. On December 9, 2003, the Japanese Diet passed the Humanitarian Relief and Iraqi Reconstruction Special Measures Law that allowed Prime Minister Koizumi to dispatch the Self Defence Forces (SDF) to Iraq. In January 2004, Japan sent a total of 1,000 military personnel (including 550 Ground Self-Defence Force personnel and 450 Maritime Self-Defence Force and Air Self- Defence Force personnel) to Iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and take part in reconstruction activities. This was the first time in the post-war period Japanese troops were sent overseas without an inter- national mandate. Japan withdrew its ground forces in 2006 while a Japanese self- defence forces air division stayed in Iraq until the expiration of the UN authorisation for multilateral forces in Iraq in 2008. Indeed, under Bush, military cooperation between Washington and Tokyo in Afghanistan and Iraq became a new dimension and a symbol of their alliance. ===North Korea=== Bush publicly condemned Kim Jong-il of North Korea and identified North Korea as one of the three states in an \"axis of evil\" in his 2002 State of the Union Address. He said that \"the United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\" and that \"North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens\" Within months, \"both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994.\" President Bush in his 2005 State of the Union Address, stated that \"We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions\" and that \"In the next 4 years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time\".State of the Union Address. February 2, 2005. North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on \"[preventing] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world\". Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to \"a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula\", and said that \"transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States\", for which North Korea would be held accountable. North Korea had developed weapons of mass destruction for several years prior to Bush's inauguration, and the Clinton administration had sought to trade economic assistance for an end to the North Korean WMD program. Though Secretary of State Powell urged the continuation of the rapprochement, other administration officials, including Vice President Cheney, were more skeptical of the good faith of the North Koreans. Bush instead sought to isolate North Korea in the hope that the regime would eventually collapse.Mann (2015), pp. 186–189 North Korea launched missile tests on July 5, 2006, leading to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695. The country said on October 3, 2006 \"The U.S. extreme threat of a nuclear war and sanctions and pressure compel the DPRK to conduct a nuclear test\", which the Bush administration denied and denounced. Days later on October 9, 2006, North Korea followed through on its promise to test nuclear weapons. On October 14, 2006, the Security Council unanimously passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, sanctioning North Korea for the test. In the waning days of his presidency, Bush attempted to re-open negotiations with North Korea, but North Korea continued to develop its nuclear programs. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all its nuclear programs by the end of 2007. ===Singapore=== President of United States Bush and Prime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong signed a bilateral free trade agreement on May 6, 2003; the agreement entered into force on January 1, 2004. The growth of U.S. investment in Singapore and the large number of Americans living there enhance opportunities for contact between Singapore and the United States. ===South Korea=== thumb|left|Bush talks with South Korean President days after the 9/11 attacks President Bush simultaneously improved relations with South Korea. On February 20, 2002, during Bush's visit to South Korea, President Bush and Kim Dae-jung President of South Korea recognized that the South Korea-U.S. alliance is indispensable not only for stability on the Korean Peninsula but also in Northeast Asia as a whole. Furthermore, President Bush and Kim Dae-Jung expressed satisfaction that the bilateral alliance is not limited to cooperation in security matters but that the comprehensive partnership has expanded and developed to all areas, including political, economic, and diplomatic arenas. President Bush and president Kim Dae-jung exchanged views about the war against terrorism and future course of action. and Dae-Jung praised President Bush for the success in the war against terrorism under his outstanding leadership and indicated that South Korea as an ally would do its utmost to cooperate and provide full support. In December 2001, South Korea deployed troops to the U.S.-led War in Afghanistan . Afterwards, South Korea took only the role of providing medical and vocational training by assisting the United States with only two dozen volunteers working inside Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul. According to an ISAF statement, on June 30, 2008, South Korea returned, operating a small hospital near the airbase in Bagram with military and civilian personnel. In February 2004, South Korea deployed troops to Iraq as part of the coalltion forces to provide support to U.S. forces in the Iraq War, which was also another boost in U.S.-ROK Relations. ===Taiwan=== Bush's hostile position toward China in the 2000 campaign and early months of his presidency was suddenly reversed after 9/11, and his especially friendly attitude toward Taiwan became a casualty. During his campaign Bush had warned that Clinton was too friendly with China, which he saw as a strategic competitor. Early on as president Bush increased arms sales to Taiwan, including 8 submarines. He was asked on April 25, 2001, \"if Taiwan were attacked by China, do we [The U.S.] have an obligation to defend the Taiwanese?\" He responded, \"Yes, we do... and the Chinese must understand that. The United States would do whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself.\" He made it understood that \"though we have common interests, the Chinese must understand that there will be some areas where we disagree.\" However, on the advice of Rice and Powell, he later explained that he was not changing America's historical relationships.Jean Edward Smith, Bush (2016) p 197. The shock of 9/11 force Bush to move closer to China. Soon he was calling China a strategic partner in the war on terror and postponing deals with Taiwan.Guy Roberts, \"Circling the Middle Kingdom: George W. Bush and China 1999–2003\" Australasian Journal of American Studies (2011) 30#1 pp 57-71. Taiwan's leadership was increasingly nervous in the early 21st century. It had to deal with growing isolation around the world because of China's pressure on other countries. In economic terms, it was facing worsening trade relationships with major trading partners. According to Chen-Don Tso, Taiwan was unable to make free trade agreements with them. Its main goal was to reach an explicit partnership with the United States. However, repeated efforts by Taiwan especially in 2003 to 2006 were rejected by Washington, in its quest to improve relations with Beijing.Chen-Don Tso, \"The US-Taiwan FTA during the Bush-Chen Era Revisited: Trade and Strategic Accounts Compared\". Issues & Studies 48.1 (2012) pp 5184. ==Europe== ===Historical background=== Bush made his first visit to Europe in June 2001. Bush came under criticism from European leaders for the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, which was aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. He asserted that the Kyoto Protocol is \"unfair and ineffective\" because it would exempt 80 percent of the world and \"cause serious harm to the U.S. economy\". Post September 11, President Bush worked closely with his NATO allies in Europe, to fight against the Taliban and Al- Qaeda, in Afghanistan. However, after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, relations were strained with France and Germany, who strongly opposed the invasion. But President Bush had an excellent relationship with Tony Blair, of Britain, and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, which took part in the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine. However, Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, both undemocratically elected and fiercely autocratic, received official state visits to the White House, along with increased economic and military assistance. The President had encouraged both leaders to hold free and fair elections early on in his second term, but in fact neither leader carried out significant reforms. ===Belarus=== President Bush signed the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 on October 20, 2004, to impose sanctions on the Belarus government of Alexander Lukashenko. The law expresses the sense of Congress that the Belarusian authorities should not receive various types of non-humanitarian financial aid from the U.S. It also calls for the President to report to Congress on arms sales by Belarus to state sponsors of terrorism and on the personal wealth and assets of senior Belarus officials. President Bush said in his signing statement of October 20, 2004, \"will work with our allies and partners to assist those seeking to return Belarus to its rightful place among the Euro-Atlantic community of democracies.\" In June 2006, President Bush issued executive order to freeze the US assets of hard-line Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and nine other individuals deemed obstacles to democracy in the former Soviet republic. \"There is simply no place in a Europe whole and free for a regime of this kind\", Bush said in a letter to the US Congress announcing his executive order, which affects assets held in the United States or by US financial institutions. On December 8, 2006, the United States House of Representatives passed, and (following Senate enactment) on January 12, 2007, President Bush signed into law, the Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act of 2006, a statute amending and updating the act. ===Czech Republic=== President Bush enjoyed a strong relationship with President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel. On January 30, 2003, Havel signed The letter of the eight supporting the U.S. led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Havel also deployed Czech forces in the Iraq War as part the Coalition forces in May 2003. Havel's successor Václav Klaus, also deployed Czech forces in the U.S. led coalition War in Afghanistan in 2004. ===Denmark=== right|thumb|250px|President Bush and Prime Minister of Denmark Rasmussen enjoyed a strong relationship President Bush and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen enjoyed a strong friendship. Denmark with Rasmussen, deployed forces to the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan in 2001 as part of NATO forces in the International Security Assistance Force. Rasmussen strongly supported the 2003 Iraq War and was one of the signatories of The letter of the eight on January 30, 2003. As in most European countries he faced considerable opposition, both in the parliament and in the general population. Subsequent opinion polls suggested the Danish population's opinion was split on the issue. One vocal protester managed to get into the Danish parliament during the period before the war, where he poured red paint on the prime minister while yelling \"Du har blod på dine hænder\" (literally: \"You have blood on your hands\"). A member of the Danish parliament for the socialist Red-Green Alliance, Pernille Rosenkrantz-Theil, stated that it was a reaction she might have made under the circumstances, although she later denounced such behaviour. Denmark was one of only five countries to take part in the actual invasion operations (the others being the U.S., UK, Poland and Australia) though the contingent mainly consisted of two minor warships and staff and radio units that were never involved in actual combat. In the months after the initial phase of the war, Danish troops participated in the multi-national force stationed in Iraq. Approximately 550 Danish troops were stationed in Iraq from 2004 and into 2007, first at \"Camp Dannevang\" and later at \"Camp Einherjer\", both near Basra. When the contingent of troops left around August 2007, it was not replaced and Denmark shifted its focus to non-military support around Baghdad. The official reason provided is that the Iraqi government should now be able to handle security in the Basra area. Critics of Rasmussen argued that the withdrawal was motivated by decreasing domestic support for the war. ===France=== France with President Jacques Chirac deployed French forces to NATO's U.S. led-coalition war in Afghanistan in 2001, Chronologie de l'engagement français en Afghanistan , Le Point, 11 Février 2009 but relations with France became strained after Chirac emerged as a leading voice against Bush and Tony Blair in 2003 during the organization and deployment of American and British forces participating in a military coalition to forcibly remove the government of Iraq controlled by the Ba'ath Party under the leadership of Saddam Hussein. Despite British and American pressure, Chirac threatened to veto, at that given point, a resolution in the UN Security Council that would authorise the use of military force to rid Iraq of alleged weapons of mass destruction, and rallied other governments to his position. \"Iraq today does not represent an immediate threat that justifies an immediate war\", Chirac said on March 18, 2003. French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin acquired much of his popularity for his speech against the war at the United Nations (UN). ===Germany=== German chancellor Gerhard Schröder sent forces to Afghanistan as part of NATO operations of the U.S.led war in Afghanistan because due to Germany having a long experience with terrorism itself, Schröder declared solidarity with the United States after the September 11 attacks in 2001. When Schröder left office, Germany had 2,000 troops in Afghanistan, the largest contingent from any nation other than the United States, UK, France, Canada and after two years Afghanistan. However, relations with Germany became strained, after Schröder later spoke out strongly against the 2003 invasion of Iraq and refused any military assistance in that enterprise. Schröder's stance caused political friction between the US and Germany, in particular because he used this topic for his 2002 election campaign. Schröder's stance set the stage for alleged anti-American statements by members of the SPD. The parliamentary leader of the SPD, Ludwig Stiegler, compared Bush to Julius Caesar while Schröder's Minister of Justice, Herta Däubler-Gmelin, likened Bush's foreign policy to that of Adolf Hitler. Schröder's critics accused him of enhancing, and campaigning on, anti-American sentiments in Germany. After his 2002 re-election, Schröder and Bush rarely met and their animosity was seen as a widening political gap between the US and Europe. Bush stated in his memoirs that Schröder initially promised to support the Iraq war but changed his mind with the upcoming German elections and public opinion strongly against the invasion, to which Schröder responded saying that Bush was \"not telling the truth\". When asked in March 2003 if he were at all self-critical about his position on Iraq, Schröder replied, \"I very much regret there were excessive statements\" from himself and former members of his government (which capitalised on the war's unpopularity).John Vinocur (March 5, 2003), Schroeder is edging closer to Blair views The New York Times. ===Italy=== President Bush enjoyed a strong relationship with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Italy, with Berlusconi in office, became a solid ally of the United States due to his support in deploying Italian troops in the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War following the 2003 invasion of Iraq in the war on terror. On January 30, 2003, Berlusconi signed The letter of the eight supporting US. policy on Iraq. Berlusconi, in his meetings with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and President Bush, said that he pushed for \"a clear turnaround in the Iraqi situation\" and for a quick handover of sovereignty to the government chosen by the Iraqi people. Italy had some 3,200 troops deployed in Southern Iraq, the third largest contingent there after the American and British forces. When Romano Prodi became Prime Minister, Italian troops were gradually withdrawn from Iraq in the second half of 2006 with the last soldiers leaving the country in December of that year. ===NATO=== In November 2002, at a NATO summit Bush stated \"Our NATO alliance faces dangers very different from those it was formed to confront. Yet, never has our need for collective defense been more urgent. The Soviet Union is gone, but freedom still has enemies. We're threatened by terrorism, bred within failed states, it's present within our own cities. We're threatened by the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons which are produced by outlaw regimes and could be delivered either by missile or terrorist cell. For terrorists and terrorist states, every free nation is a potential target, including the free nations of Europe\". Bush then stated \"To meet all of this century's emerging threats from terror camps in remote regions to hidden laboratories of outlaw regimes, NATO must develop new military capabilities. NATO forces must become better able to fight side by side. Those forces must be more mobile and more swiftly deployed. The allies need more special operations forces, better precision strike capabilities, and more modern command structures. Few NATO members will have state-of-the-art capabilities in all of these areas; I recognize that. But every nation should develop some. Ours is a military alliance, and every member must make a military contribution to that alliance. For some allies, this will require higher defense spending. For all of us, it will require more effective defense spending, with each nation adding the tools and technologies to fight and win a new kind of war\". Bush then stated \"The United States proposes the creation of a NATO response force that will bring together well-equipped, highly ready air, ground and sea forces from NATO allies – old and new. This force will be prepared to deploy on short notice wherever it is needed. A NATO response force will take time to create and we should begin that effort here in Prague. Yet, security against new threats requires more than just new capabilities. Free nations must accept our shared obligations to keep the peace. The world needs the nations of this continent to be active in the defense of freedom; not inward-looking or isolated by indifference. Ignoring dangers or excusing aggression may temporarily avert conflict, but they don't bring true peace\". ===Poland=== President Bush enjoyed a strong relationship with Poland, As well as Poland deploying its forces in supporting the global war on terror, Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and coalition efforts in Iraq (where Polish contingent was one of the largest). Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller's government, together with President Kwaśniewski, made a decision in March 2003 to join the coalition of the willing and deploy Polish troops to Iraq, targeting at overthrowing Saddam Hussein's government. Leszek Miller was also a co-signatory of \"the letter of 8\", signed by eight European prime ministers, supporting the US position on Iraq. Already in 2002 Miller gave permission to the U.S. government to run a secret CIA prison at Stare Kiejkuty military training center, three hours North of Warsaw. Years later he is facing accusations of acting anti-constitutionally by having tolerated the imprisonment and torture of prisoners. ===Russia=== A planned missile defense system in Eastern Europe poses no threat to Russia, Bush, said April 1, 2008, responding to concerns that the U.S. might use interceptor missiles for offensive purposes. His comments came before he left Kyiv for a NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, that is expected to highlight divisions over the plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Bush failed to resolve their differences over U.S. plans for the planned missile defense system based in Poland and the Czech Republic, on their meeting in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on April 6, 2008, but said they had agreed a \"strategic framework\" to guide future U.S.-Russian relations, in which Russia and the U.S. said they recognized that the era in which each had considered the other to be a \"strategic threat or enemy\" was over. Before leaving April 1, 2008, for Bucharest, Bush told that Russia will not be able to veto Georgia's or Ukraine's inclusion into NATO. Bush said that both countries should be able to take part in NATO's Membership Action Plan, which is designed to help aspiring countries meet the requirements of joining the alliance. Bush added that Ukraine already contributes to NATO missions, specifically in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. Ukraine also has demonstrated a commitment to democracy. Bush denied that the United States might ease off on membership plans for Ukraine and Georgia if Russia acquiesces on the missile shield. ===Spain=== Prime Minister of Spain José María Aznar actively supported Bush in the war on terrorism by first deploying Spanish forces in the U.S.-led coalition War in Afghanistan in 2001. Aznar then met with Bush in a private meeting before 2003 invasion of Iraq to discuss the situation of in the United Nations Security Council. The Spanish newspaper El País leaked a partial transcript of the meeting. Aznar actively encouraged and supported the Bush administration's foreign policy and the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, and was one of the signatories of The letter of the eight defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the Iraqi government's nuclear proliferation. Aznar then deployed Spanish forces to the Iraq War as part of Multi-National Force – Iraq coalition forces. The majority of the Spanish population, including some members of Aznar's Partido Popular, were against the war. After the Spanish general election in 2004, in which the Spanish socialists received more votes than expected as a result, besides other issues, of the government's handling of the 2004 Madrid train bombings, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero succeeded Aznar as Prime Minister. Before being elected, Zapatero had opposed the American policy in regard to Iraq pursued by Aznar. During the electoral campaign Zapatero had promised to withdraw the troops if control in Iraq was not passed to the United Nations after June 30 (the ending date of the initial Spanish military agreement with the multinational coalition that had overthrown Saddam Hussein). On April 19, 2004, Zapatero announced the withdrawal of the 1300 Spanish troops in Iraq. The decision aroused international support worldwide, though the American Government claimed that the terrorists could perceive it as \"a victory obtained due to 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings\". John Kerry, then Democratic party candidate for the American Presidency, asked Zapatero not to withdraw the Spanish soldiers. Some months after withdrawing the troops, the Zapatero government agreed to increase the number of Spanish soldiers in Afghanistan and to send troops to Haiti to show the Spanish Government's willingness to spend resources on international missions approved by the UN. ===United Kingdom=== President Bush and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair enjoyed a strong relationship. On September 20, 2001, during Bush's address to a joint session of congress, Bush declared \"America has no truer friend than Great Britain\". Blair deployed British forces to NATO's war in Afghanistan, second only to the US in sending forces. Blair then took the lead (against the opposition of France, Canada, Germany, China, and Russia) in advocating the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and Blair was also one of the signatories of The letter of the eight on January 30, 2003. Again Britain under Blair was second only to the US in sending forces to Iraq. Both sides wound down after 2009, and withdrew their last troops in 2011. President Bush and Prime Minister Blair provided sustained mutual political and diplomatic support and won votes in Congress and parliament against their critics at home.Shawcross (2004) ch 2 ==Greater Middle East== ===Afghanistan=== thumb|right|President Bush addressing the media at the Pentagon, September 17, 2001 In a September 20, 2001, address to a joint session of congress, Bush condemned Osama bin Laden and his organization Al-Qaeda, and issued an ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was operating, to \"hand over the terrorists, or... share in their fate\". On October 7, 2001, the US led a NATO invasion of Afghanistan, instigating the global war on terror and what became the early phase of the US led-coalition War in Afghanistan. President Bush confirmed the strikes in his address to the nation, Bush stated that \"Taliban military sites and terrorist training grounds would be targeted\". \"Food, medicine and supplies would be dropped to the starving and suffering men, women and children of Afghanistan\". NATO forces scoured the region for 9/11 alleged mastermind Osama Bin Laden and his terrorist network Al-Qaeda and drove the fundamentalist Islamic Taliban regime, which was sheltering and providing sanctuary for Bin Laden and Al- Qaeda, from power. However once Bin Laden left Afghanistan and took up sanctuary in Pakistan, Bush said that he was \"not that concerned about him\" as the Al-Qaeda leader continued to plot attacks against America. The main goals of the war were to defeat the Taliban, drive al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated, but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders. Later that month the UN had installed the Afghan Transitional Administration chaired by Hamid Karzai. the U.S. under the Bush administration supported the new government of Karzai by maintaining a high level of troops to establish the authority of his government as well as combat Taliban insurgency. Both Afghanistan and the United States resumed diplomatic ties in late 2001. In 2002, based on UNICEF figures, Nicholas Kristof reported that \"our invasion of Afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade\" as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid.Kristof, Nicholas D., \"A Merciful War\", The New York Times, February 1, 2002. \"Now aid is pouring in and lives are being saved on an enormous scale. UNICEF, for example, has vaccinated 734,000 children against measles over the last two months, in a country where virtually no one had been vaccinated against the disease in the previous 10 years. Because measles often led to death in Afghanistan, the vaccination campaign will save at least 35,000 children's lives each year... Heidi J. Larson of UNICEF says that if all goes well, child and maternal mortality rates will drop in half in Afghanistan over the next five years. That would mean 112,000 fewer children and 7,500 fewer pregnant women dying each year.\" Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of Tora Bora, which the Bush administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops. It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration. Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, remains at large. Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that the Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, in March 2007, the Bush administration deployed another more than 3,500 troops to Afghanistan to expand the fight against the Taliban. In June 2004, United States Forces began Drone strikes in Pakistan during the administration of President Bush, along the Federal Tribal Areas against Taliban and Al-Qaeda militants. Major criticisms started to emerge from international human rights organizations about the United States policy of detaining alleged Taliban and Al-Qaeda combatants and refusing to grant these detainees their rights as prisoners of war as detailed in the Geneva Conventions. Other allegations stated that numerous captured Taliban fighters possessed no link to either Al-Qaeda or the Taliban. Instead these fighters had the misfortune of being forcibly recruited into the Taliban military during the American invasion. The practice of impressment was systematic of the Taliban regime which would raid villages for able bodied men to serve on the front lines for a specific time period. In 2005, the United States and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. On March 1, 2006, Bush along with his wife Laura made a visit to Afghanistan where they greeted US soldiers, met with Afghan officials and later appeared at a special inauguration ceremony at the U.S. Embassy.Pajhwok Afghan News, US lawmakers laud Afghan progress under Karzai (December 6, 2007) The United States under the Bush administration took the leading role in the overall reconstruction of Afghanistan by providing billions of dollars to the Afghan National Security Forces, building national roads, government and educational institutions. President Bush and his administration labelled the detainees as \"unlawful combatants\" deemed to pose a threat to the U.S. or to have information about terrorist structures, plans and tactics. The administration has said that such detainees can be held for \"as long as necessary\". Critics claim that anyone accused of a crime has a right to a fair trial and question whether people like Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, can be called an \"unlawful combatant\". In the case of Zaeef, they claim he cannot be a \"combatant\" because he was crippled during the Soviet occupation and that he wasn't \"unlawful\" because he was ambassador of his country. The Bush administration and its supporters claim that the war against America by Al- Qaeda is ongoing, that it is unconventional, and that the \"battlefield\" extends into the U.S. itself. According to the declassified April 2006 National Intelligence Estimate, \"United States-led counterterrorism efforts have seriously damaged the leadership of Al-Qaeda and disrupted its operations; however, we judge that al-Qa'ida will continue to pose the greatest threat to the Homeland and US interests abroad by a single terrorist organization. We also assess that the global jihadist movement—which includes Al-Qaeda, affiliated and independent terrorist groups, and emerging networks and cells—is spreading and adapting to counterterrorism efforts.\" On September 6, 2006, President Bush confirmed, for the first time, that the CIA had held \"high-value detainees\" for interrogation in secret prisons around the world. He also announced that fourteen Al-Qaeda senior captives, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were being transferred from CIA custody, to military custody, at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and that these fourteen captives could now expect to face charges before Guantanamo military commissions. Although the Bush administration released over 100 detainees and authorized military tribunals for the rest, the legal framework governing them has been slow in the making. According to Human Rights Watch, as of January 2004, \"the public still [did] not know who the detainees are, what they [had] allegedly done, and whether and when they will be charged with crimes or released. There [had] been no hearings to determine the legal status of detainees and no judicial review—in short, no legal process at all.\" In February 2002 the United States began releasing several dozen detainees to their home countries, including many British and Pakistani nationals. The British detainees were briefly investigated and cleared of any British charges within 24 hours of their arrival. The domestic political equation changed in the U.S. after the September 11, 2001, attacks, bolstering the influence of the neoconservative faction of the administration and throughout Washington. The conflict in Afghanistan, and the events that had launched the war, coincided with a reassessment of foreign policy by the administration, which President Bush articulated in his first State of the Union message on January 29, 2002. Previously, September 11 had underscored the threat of attacks from terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, as opposed to nation-states, and U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan targeted the ruling Taliban militia for having harbored al-Qaeda sponsor Osama bin Laden. Now speaking of an \"axis of evil\" comprising Iran, North Korea, and Iraq in his address to Congress, Bush claimed that he was preparing to open a new front in the U.S. global \"war on terrorism\". ===Bahrain=== President Bush designated Bahrain a Major non-NATO ally in 2002. President Bush signed the Bahrain–United States Free Trade Agreement into law on January 11, 2006. The FTA was implemented on August 1, 2006, and will reduce certain barriers of trade between the two countries. ===Egypt=== President Bush enjoyed relations with Egypt under President Hosni Mubarak, However, later on Egyptian–American relations have become a little tense. This is due to a great extent to the Egyptian unwillingness to send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq in peace stabilization missions. Egypt strongly backed the U.S. in its war against international terrorism after the September 11 attacks of 2001 but refused to send troops to Afghanistan during the war and after it. Egypt also opposed U.S. military intervention of March 2003 in Iraq through their membership in the African Union and the Arab League, continued to oppose U.S. occupation of the country after the war and further refused to comply with U.S. requests to send troops to the country even under a UN umbrella. President Mubarak spoke out against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, arguing that the Israeli–Palestinian conflict should have been resolved first. He also said the war would cause \"100 Bin Ladens\". However, as president he did not support an immediate US withdrawal from Iraq because he believed it would probably lead to chaos. The issue of participation in the post-war construction efforts in Iraq has been controversial in Egypt and in the Arab world as a whole. Opponents say that the war was illegal and it is necessary to wait until Iraq has legal representative government to deal with it. On the other hand, supporters of participation argued that the responsibility to protect Iraqis and to help them in time of crisis should prevail and guide the Egyptian action in Iraq, despite the fact that the Iraqis do not agree. US officials quoted in USA Today described Egyptian security and military as having shared \"valuable intelligence\" and providing other \"useful counterterrorism assistance\", in the 1980, 90s and \"particularly in the decade since the 9/11 attacks\". Under President Hosni Mubarak and his intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, the U.S. has had \"an important partnership\" in counterterrorism. ===Iran=== In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush labeled Iran as a member of the \"Axis of Evil\", where he stated \"Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom\". Bush also accused Iran of aiding terrorist organizations. In June 2005, Bush issued Executive Order 13382 freezing the assets of individuals connected with Iran's nuclear program. In 2006, Iran re-opened three of its nuclear facilities, potentially allowing it to begin the process of building a nuclear bomb. After the resumption of the Iranian nuclear program, many within the U.S. military and foreign policy community speculated that Bush might attempt to impose regime change on Iran. This was evident in the Iran Freedom and Support Act legislation bill signed by President Bush on September 30, 2006, that appropriated $10 million and directed the President of the United States to spend that money in support of \"pro-democracy groups\" opposed to the Iranian government. Opponents claimed the bill was a first step towards a US-led invasion of the country.Dennis Kucinich called the act a \"steppingstone to war\". \"Kucinich Speaks Out Against House Bill That Lays The Ground Work For War Against Iran\" In December 2006, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1737, which imposed sanctions on Iran in order to curb its nuclear program. There has been much controversy surrounding Iran and its nuclear program in the past few years. The controversy centers on the Iranian enrichment of uranium. Iran officials have stated that they are enriching the uranium to fuel civilian reactors as permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and other international agreements, but the processes that Iran has been developing to reprocess and enrich uranium are also critical components for the development of a nuclear weapon. Since there exists some circumstantial evidence that Iran, classified by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism, may have intentions of pursuing a weapons program, the Iranian nuclear program became a major foreign policy of the United States. ===Iraq=== Beginning with his January 29, 2002 State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an \"axis of evil\" allied with terrorists and posing \"a grave and growing danger\" to U.S. interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction. Bush declared, \"Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror.\" Announcing that he would possibly take action to topple the Iraqi government, he claimed, \"The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade.\" and claimed \"This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children\". and that \"This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors\". and that \"This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilised world\". In the latter half of 2002, CIA reports contained assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. Contentions that the Bush administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.Hersh, Seymour M., \"The Stovepipe\", The New Yorker, October 27, 2003. Bush began formally making his case to the international community for an invasion of Iraq on September 12, 2002, in his address to the United Nations General Assembly.George W. Bush, \"President's Remarks at the United Nations General Assembly: Remarks by the President in Address to the United Nations General Assembly, New York, New York\", official transcript, press release, The White House, September 12, 2002. Retrieved May 24, 2007. In October 2002, Congress passed a legislation titled the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq signed by President Bush on October 16, 2002.Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (PDF) authorizing the use of the United States Armed Forces against Saddam Hussein's Iraq government. On November 20, 2002, at a NATO summit in Prague, Czech Republic, Bush and President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel held a joint news conference, where Bush stated \"It's very important for our NATO nations as well as all free nations to work collectively to see to it that Saddam Hussein disarms\", \"However, should he choose not to disarm, the United States will lead a coalition of the willing to disarm him and at that point in time, all our nations will be able choose whether or not they want to participate.\" In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi disarmament mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries. The Bush administration's claim that the Iraq War was part of the war on terror had been questioned and contested by political analysts.Williams, Shirley. \"The seeds of Iraq's future terror\" President Bush in his 2003 State of the Union Address, on January 28, 2003, declared Saddam Hussein was the worst, and \"a brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.\" In this context, Bush also said, \"The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa\". Although no agreement on authorizing force could be found within the United Nations Security Council, the war was ultimately launched in March 2003, after Bush, in a speech on March 17, 2003, effectively had set out a declaration of his objectives as \"assuring [the] national security\" of the United States, and \"no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents, no more torture chambers and rape rooms\". Bush also issued an ultimatum stating, \"Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing.\" thumb|President Bush addresses the world about U.S. intentions regarding Saddam Hussein and Iraq on March 17, 2003 President Bush in his address to the nation from the Oval Office on March 19, 2003, officially announced the beginning of the invasion of Iraq, here he stated \"On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein's ability to wage war. These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign. More than 35 countries are giving crucial support from the use of naval and air bases, to help with intelligence and logistics, to the deployment of combat units. Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense\". The military action was dubbed \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\". More than 20 nations (most notably the United Kingdom), designated the \"coalition of the willing\" joined the United States in invading Iraq. They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003, which resulted in the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime 24 year rule. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's \"Mission Accomplished\" speech was later criticized as premature. President Bush then appointed Paul Bremer Presidential Envoy to Iraq on May 9, 2003, and administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority, his appointment declared him subject to the \"authority, direction and control\" of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. On December 14, 2003, President Bush announced the capture of Saddam Hussein, after U.S. forces captured him in Operation Red Dawn and said that Saddam would \"face the justice he denied to millions. For the Ba'athist holdouts responsible for the violence, there will be no return to the corrupt power and privilege they once held\". From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full- scale civil war in Iraq. Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was \"grave and deteriorating\". While Bush admitted there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy. According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians as of 2016. In January 2005, free, democratic elections were held in Iraq for the first time in 50 years. According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, \"This is the greatest day in the history of this country.\" Bush praised the event as well, saying that the Iraqis \"have taken rightful control of their country's destiny\". This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as president and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds. In June 2006, President Bush announced the death of Abu Musab al- Zarqawi, the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, after U.S. forces killed him in an airstrike and stated that through his every action Zarqawi sought to defeat America and its coalition partners by turning Iraq into a safe haven for al- Qaeda. Bush also stated, \"Now Zarqawi has met his end and this violent man will never murder again.\" On January 10, 2007, Bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq, as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2billion (equivalent to $billion in ) for these programs. On January 23, 2007, in the 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush announced \"deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq\". On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying the debate over the conflict was \"understandable\" but insisting that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial. thumb|upright|President Bush announces the new strategy on Iraq from the White House Library, January 10, 2007 In March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's \"bold decision\" to launch the Battle of Basra against the Mahdi Army, calling it \"a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq\". He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections. By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began, and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces. During his last visit in Iraq in December 2008, Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi threw both of his shoes to Bush amid official press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.Bush shoe-ing worst Arab insult , BBC, December 16, 2008. Al- Zaidi yelled the strikes on Bush as \"farewell kiss\" and \"for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq.\" In March 2010, Center for Public Integrity released a report that President Bush's administration had made more than 900 false pretenses in a two-year period about alleged threat of Iraq against the United States, as his rationale to engage war in Iraq.\"Study: Bush led U.S. to war on 'false pretenses'\" . Retrieved on March 22, 2010 Senior war crimes prosecutor Benjamin B. Ferencz has suggested that Bush should be tried in the International Criminal Court for '269 war crime charges' related to the Iraq War.Glantz, A.: \"Bush and Saddam Should Both Stand Trial, Says Nuremberg Prosecutor \", OneWorld U.S., August 25, 2006. URL last accessed December 12, 2006. Criticism also came from the governments of many countries, notably from many on the United Nations Security Council, who argued that the war broke international law. (Article VI of the U.S. Constitution states that \"all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land\" and that \"all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution\", while Article III states that the judicial power of the US Supreme Court extends to \"all... Treaties made\". This makes a violation of international law also a violation of the \"supreme Law of The Land\" of America, and withholds immunity from government officials, including the president.) See Worldwide government positions on war on Iraq and The UN Security Council and the Iraq war. For its part, the U.S. administration soon presented a list of countries called the coalition of the willing which supported its position. A later aspect of the criticism has been the death toll in Iraq; over 100,000 Iraqi civilians and 4000 U.S. soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the war mainly during the ensuing insurgency and civil war.Operation Iraqi Freedom iCasualties In 2004, public assertions by Bush's former Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill and counter-terrorism expert Richard Clarke raised questions about the credibility of the Bush administration's pre-war claims. Both presented evidence that questioned how focused the Bush administration was on combating Al-Qaeda (which was operating out of Afghanistan, not Iraq) before September 11. Specifically, O'Neill presented classified and unclassified documents indicating that planning for a war with Iraq and the subsequent occupation began at the first National Security Council meeting and continued with each meeting. Clarke presented testimony and witnesses concerning how Bush and much of his cabinet tried to find excuses to attack Iraq immediately after September 11, such as associating it with September 11, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, and claiming that Iraq posed an imminent threat, which implied that a war against Iraq would be legal by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. Testimony at the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (ongoing during March 2004) has included claims of how much of the Bush administration's immediate post-9/11 emphasis on Iraq was appropriate and proportional to the overall picture of terrorism, especially in light of the administration's subsequent decision to pursue military action in Afghanistan first, the fact that organizations accused of 9/11 are in Afghanistan, not Iraq, and that no links have been found between these organizations and Saddam Hussein. The commission's report is expected to be released before the Presidential election. On June 16, 2004, the USA's 9/11 Commission filed an initial report on its findings, stating that it found \"no credible evidence\" of a \"collaborative relationship\" between pre-invasion Iraq and Al-Qaeda or of Iraqi involvement in the 9/11 attacks. The inability of the U.S. to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has led to greater domestic criticism of the administration's Iraq policy. Several of the statements that Bush and his administration made leading up to the war in Iraq, especially those involving claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, have been criticized as misleading or inaccurate. Particularly controversial was Bush's claim in the 2003 State of the Union Address that British Intelligence had discovered that Iraq was seeking to buy uranium from Africa. Officials and diplomats disputed the evidence for this claim, especially after a document describing an attempted purchase from Niger, which was presented to the United Nations Security Council by Colin Powell, was found to be a forgery. This led to a public embarrassment for George Tenet, the director of the CIA, as well as the Valerie Plame scandal. Much criticism on these issues has come from political opponents of Bush. The Iraq war was a significant issue in the 2004 Democratic primary, including the campaigns of Howard Dean, John Kerry, Al Sharpton, and Dennis Kucinich. However, State Department documents declassified in 2006 cite hundreds of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq. Nonetheless, it was soon quickly revealed that the particular weapons in question were WMD Saddam had obtained during the Iran-Iraq war, which had long since become stale and non-functional On March 24, 2004, Bush joked about the weapons of mass destruction issue at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner. While showing slides of himself searching the Oval Office, he joked, \"those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere... nope, no weapons over there... maybe under here?\" Some found it tasteless of him to be joking about the issue. Others defended the joke as being in line with the self-deprecatory sort of humor that has come to be expected of presidents when they speak at that event. On September 26, 2006, Bush declassified the key judgments of the April 2006 National Intelligence Estimate. The estimate, titled Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States, states the following: \"We assess that the Iraq jihad is shaping a new generation of terrorist leaders and operatives; perceived jihadist success there would inspire more fighters to continue the struggle elsewhere. The Iraq conflict has become the 'cause celebre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement. Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive themselves, and be perceived, to have failed, we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight.\" On December 1, 2008, during an interview with ABC World News, Bush stated \"The biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq. A lot of people put their reputations on the line and said the weapons of mass destruction is a reason to remove Saddam Hussein\". \"I think I was unprepared for war. In other words, I didn't campaign and say, 'Please vote for me, I'll be able to handle an attack'... I didn't anticipate war.\" and on early withdrawal of troops, \"It was a tough call, particularly, since a lot of people were advising for me to get out of Iraq, or pull back in Iraq\". On December 14, 2008, during a joint press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Bush was publicly insulted when an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at the President as Bush and al-Maliki were about to shake hands. The offender, later identified as television correspondent Muntadar al- Zeidi, leapt from his chair and quickly hurled first one shoe and then the other at the president, who was about 20 feet away. Bush successfully dodged both projectiles which were aimed at his head. Zeidi worked for Al-Baghdadia television, an Iraqi-owned station based in Cairo. He was wrestled to the ground by security officials and then hauled away, moaning as they left the room. \"So what if the guy threw a shoe at me?\" Bush said, comparing the action to political protests in the United States. Al-Baghdadia's Baghdad manager told the Associated Press he had no idea what prompted his reporter to go on the attack. The Iraqi government has demanded an on-air apology from his employer. ===Israel=== President Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon established good relations in their March and June 2001 meetings. On October 4, 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks, Sharon accused the Bush administration of appeasing the Palestinians at Israel's expense in a bid for Arab support for the US anti-terror campaign. The White House said that the remark was unacceptable. Rather than apologize for the remark, Sharon said that the United States failed to understand him. Also, the United States criticized the Israeli practice of assassinating Palestinians believed to be engaged in terrorism, which appeared to some Israelis to be inconsistent with the US policy of pursuing Osama bin Laden \"dead or alive\". In 2003, in the middle of the Second Intifada and a sharp economic downturn in Israel, the US provided Israel with $9 billion in conditional loan guarantees made available through 2011 and negotiated each year at the US–Israel Joint Economic Development Group. President Bush noted in an April 14, 2002, Memorandum which came to be called \"the Bush Roadmap\" (and which established the parameters for subsequent Israel-Palestinian negotiations) the need to take into account changed \"realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers\", as well as Israel's security concerns, asserting that \"It is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949.\"Elliott Abrams, Tested by Zion: The Bush Administration and the Arab-Israeli Conflict (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013)', pp. 105ff. He later emphasized that, within these parameters, details of the borders were subjects for negotiations between the parties. Bush had maintained a desire to resume the peace process in Israel, and had openly proclaimed his desire for a Palestinian state to be created before 2005. He outlined a road map for peace in cooperation with Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations, which featured compromises that had to be made by both sides before Palestinian statehood could become a reality. One particular proposal was his insistence on new Palestinian leadership; a stance that saw the appointment of the first ever Palestinian Prime Minister on April 29, 2003. Bush had denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for continued support of violence and militant groups. The road map for peace stalled within months after more violence and the resignation of the new Palestinian Prime Minister, Mahmoud Abbas. By the end of 2003, neither side had done what was outlined in the plan. In April 2004 Bush announced that he endorsed Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to disengage from the Gaza Strip but retain Jewish settlements in the West Bank. He also announced agreement with Sharon's policy of denying the right of return. This led to condemnation from Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, Arab and European governments and was a major departure from previous U.S. foreign policy in the region. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak commented Bush's policies had led to an 'unprecedented hatred' of Arabs for the U.S. During the 2006 Lebanon War, On July 14, 2006, the US Congress was notified of a potential sale of $210 million worth of jet fuel to Israel. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency noted that the sale of the JP-8 fuel, should it be completed, will \"enable Israel to maintain the operational capability of its aircraft inventory\", and that \"The jet fuel will be consumed while the aircraft is in use to keep peace and security in the region\". It was reported on July 24 that the United States was in the process of providing Israel with \"bunker buster\" bombs, which would allegedly be used to target the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah guerilla group and destroy its trenches.\"Israel to get U.S. 'bunker buster' bombs – report\" , Reuters, July 24, 2006 American media also questioned whether Israel violated an agreement not to use cluster bombs on civilian targets. Although many of the cluster bombs used were advanced M-85 munitions developed by Israel Military Industries, Israel also used older munitions purchased from the US. Evidence during the conflict, hitting civilian areas, although the civilian population had mostly fled. Israel asserts that civilian damage was unavoidable, as Hezbollah ensconced itself in highly populated areas. Simultaneously, indiscriminate Hezbollah rocket fire turned many of its northern towns into virtual ghost towns, in violation of international law. Many bomblets remained undetonated after the war, causing hazard for Lebanese civilians. Israel said that it had not violated any international law because cluster bombs are not illegal and were used only on military targets. On July 15, 2006, the United Nations Security Council again rejected pleas from Lebanon that it call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the US was the only member of out the 15-nation UN body to oppose any council action at all. On July 19, 2006, the Bush administration rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that certain conditions had to be met, not specifying what they were. John Bolton, US Ambassador to the United Nations, rejected the call for a ceasefire, on the grounds that such an action addressed the conflict only superficially: \"The notion that you just declare a ceasefire and act as if that is going to solve the problem, I think is simplistic.\" On July 26, 2006, foreign ministers from the US, Europe, and the Middle East that met in Rome vowed \"to work immediately to reach with the utmost urgency a ceasefire that puts an end to the current violence and hostilities\". However, the US maintained strong support for the Israeli campaign, and the conference's results were reported to have fallen short of Arab and European leaders' expectations. After the 2006 Lebanon war ended, President Bush said that Hezbollah was responsible for starting the war, and that the group suffered a defeat at the hands of Israel. He dismissed claims of victory by Hezbollah leaders, asking: \"how can you claim victory when at one time you were a state within a state, safe within southern Lebanon, and now you're going to be replaced by a Lebanese Army and an international force?\" In his 2010 memoir, Decision Points, Bush wrote that Israel had weakened Hezbollah and secured its northern border, but that Israel's \"shaky military performance\" cost it international credibility. He also said that Israel \"mishandled its opportunity\", and that some of the sites it attacked were of \"questionable military value\". In September 2008, The Guardian reported that the U.S. vetoed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's plan to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities the previous May. ===Jordan=== On September 28, 2001, President Bush signed the Jordan–United States Free Trade Agreement and it was the first free trade agreement (FTA) the United States signed with an Arab country (and the fourth FTA overall behind Israel, Canada, and Mexico). However, King Abdullah advised Washington against the 2003 Iraq War, but later allegedly gave the invading coalition some degree of covert and tacit support, despite the overwhelming opinion of his own public.Rick Fawn and Raymond Hinnebusch The Iraq Causes and Consequences War (US, Colorado: Lynne Rienner Publishers:2006, p. 143) The Jordanian government publicly opposed the war against Iraq. The King stressed to the United States and European Union that a diplomatic solution, in accordance with UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions 1284 (1999) and 1409 (2002), was the only appropriate model for resolving the conflict between Iraq and the UN.Rick Fawn and Raymond Hinnebusch The Iraq Causes and Consequences War (US, Colorado: Lynne Rienner Publishers:2006, p. 144) In August 2002 he told the Washington Post that an attempt to invade Iraq would be a \"tremendous mistake\" and that it could \"throw the whole area into turmoil\".G. Kessler and P. Slevin, \"Abdullah: Foreign Oppose Attack; Jordanian King to Urge Bush to Focus on Peace in Mideast, Not Invasion of Iraq\", The Washington Post, August 1, 2002 ===Kuwait=== Kuwait was the only major regional ally that supported the U.S.-led 2003 Invasion of Iraq, because Kuwait had hostility towards Saddam's Iraq stemmed from the events surrounding the first Persian Gulf War. The public appeared to consider Saddam to be as much of a threat in 2003 as he was in the past, and were particularly interested in attempts to repatriate many Kuwaiti citizens who had disappeared during the Gulf War, and were presumably languishing in Iraqi jails up until Saddam's fall from power. Kuwait also allowed the U.S. to launch the 2003 invasion of Iraq from the U.S. military bases stationed in Kuwait. However, Kuwait did not deploy forces to the Iraq War. In 2004, President Bush designated Kuwait as a Major non-NATO ally ===Lebanon=== President Bush stated Lebanon \"can serve as a great example (to other countries) of what is possible\" in the Middle East\". In April 2006, following a meeting at the White House with Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, Mr. Bush said that the United States \"strongly supports a free and independent and sovereign Lebanon\". He recalled the 2005 Cedar Revolution, in which hundreds of thousands of Lebanese protested against and forced the withdrawal of Syrian troops from their country. Prime Minister Siniora stated \"We took great joy in seeing the Cedar Revolution. We understand that the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the street to express their desire to be free required courage, and we support the desire of the people to have a government responsive to their needs and a government that is free, truly free.\" President Bush recalled Lebanon's \"great tradition\" of serving \"as a model of entrepreneurship and prosperity\". He also called for a full investigation into the February 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, which helped spur the Cedar Revolution. Prime Minister Siniora said the United States \"has been of great support\" to Lebanon, which has gone through \"major changes\" in the past year-and-a-half\" and that \"Lebanon has really been committing itself that we want the change to happen to in a democratic and a peaceful manner, but at the same time, to really stay course on course; that we are there to meet the expectations of the people to have a united, liberal, free country, and, at the same time, prosperous economy.... The United States has been of great support to Lebanon. I am really convinced that President Bush and the United States will stand beside Lebanon to have Lebanon stay as a free, democratic, united, and sovereign state.\" \"Out of the tough times [Lebanon] has been through\", said President Bush, \"will rise a state that shows that it's possible for people of religious difference to live side-by-side in peace; to show that it's possible for people to put aside past histories to live together in.... peace and hope and opportunity.\" ===Libya=== After its public announcement on December 19, 2003, Libya announced its intention to rid itself of WMD and MTCR-class missile programs. the Gaddafi government cooperated with the U.S., the U.K., the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons toward these objectives. Libya also signed the IAEA Additional Protocol and has become a State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention. In recognition of these actions, the U.S. under the Bush administration began the process of normalizing relations with Libya. The U.S. terminated the applicability of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act to Libya and President Bush signed an Executive Order on September 20, 2004, terminating the national emergency with respect to Libya and ending IEEPA-based economic sanctions. This action had the effect of unblocking assets blocked under the Executive Order sanctions. Restrictions on cargo aviation and third-party code-sharing have been lifted, as have restrictions on passenger aviation. Certain export controls remain in place. U.S. diplomatic personnel reopened the U.S. Interest Section in Tripoli on February 8, 2004. In the same month, the U.S. State Department lifted the 23-year travel ban on Libya. The U.S. Interest Section was upgraded to a U.S. Liaison Office on June 28, 2004, and to a full embassy on May 31, 2006. The establishment in 2005 of an American School in Tripoli demonstrates the increased presence of Americans in Libya, and the continuing normalization of bilateral relations. Libya re-established its diplomatic presence in Washington with the opening of an Interest Section on July 8, 2004, which was subsequently upgraded to a Liaison Office in December 2004 and to a full embassy on May 31, 2006. On May 15, 2006, the US State Department announced its intention to rescind Libya's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in recognition of the fact that Libya had met the statutory requirements for such a move: it had not provided any support for acts of international terrorism in the preceding six-month period, and had provided assurances that it would not do so in the future. On June 30, 2006, the U.S. rescinded Libya's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. See p.553. In July 2007, Mr. Gene Cretz was nominated by President Bush as ambassador to Libya. The Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate held Cretz's confirmation hearing on Wednesday, September 25, 2008. The Libyan government satisfied its responsibility and paid the remaining amount of money it owed (total of $1.5 billion) to the victims of several acts of terrorism on Friday, October 31, 2008. That same year, the United States and Libya also signed a bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation. ===Morocco=== In the 21st century, both countries have become close allies in the global \"war on terror\". Morocco was among the first Arab and Islamic states to denounce the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and declare solidarity with the American people in fighting terrorism.U.S. Department of State. Background Note: Morocco. Accessed March 29, 2010. After the September 11 attacks, Morocco has been instrumental in supporting the United States. For example, King Mohammed VI presided over a mass service in support of the victims of the September 11 attacks. Additionally, security cooperation between the two countries is well developed. King Mohammed VI collaborates with U.S. intelligence and security officials in providing intelligence and preventing terrorist attacks in the Straits of Gibraltar. In January 2004, during the Bush administration, Morocco was designated a major non-NATO ally as a reward for its collaboration. Morocco remains one of America's oldest and closest allies, a status affirmed by Morocco's zero-tolerance policy towards Al-Qaeda and their affiliated groups. Morocco also assisted the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency with questioning al-Qaeda members captured in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere Morocco also plays a pivotal role in the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative to contain Salafist groups in the Saharan and in the Sahel regions of West Africa.Rosenblum, Jennifer & Zartman, William. \"The Far West of the Near East\" in The Foreign Policies of Arab States, Korany & Dessouki eds. New York: American University in Cairo Press, 2008, p. 340 Likewise, when Casablanca was the victim of terrorist bombings on May 16, 2003, the U.S. government offered Morocco the full resources of its military and intelligence community. Furthermore, the CIA has utilized Morocco as a source for recruiting Arabic-speaking spies. The United States and Morocco signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on June 15, 2004, which went into effect on January 1, 2006. The Kingdom of Morocco submitted an official statement on the matter for a U.S. House of Representatives Congressional Hearing in June 2007. It read, in part, \"Morocco is pleased to see that the United States has over the last several years very substantially increased its engagement in the Maghreb. Morocco is a longtime partner of the United States and our experience with your great nation over the last two centuries has persuaded us that there is much that we can accomplish together. The FTA between Morocco and USA is a great opportunity for US companies to increase their market shares\".Hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of House of Representatives. \"U.S. Policy Challenges in North Africa\". Serial No. 110-76, June 6, 2007, p. 23. Accessed March 21, 2010 The FTA also stipulates broad labor protections for both countries, with a dual focus on transparency, and maintaining said protections while promoting economic growth. The explicitly defined protections laid out in the Labor section of the agreement are essentially the general rights promoted by the International Labor Organization in their 1998 declaration; however, the Labor section also provides a framework by which the countries may cooperate to extend labor rights further. The developments listed as potentially pursuable include the establishment of \"social safety net programs\", regulation of \"working conditions\", and \"timely\" creation of \"labor market statistics\". In 2008, U.S. direct investment in Morocco was about 7%, and U.S. aid to Morocco was about 4%. In 2017, US direct investment in Morocco had risen to 21.4%. ===Oman=== On November 15, 2004, the Bush administration notified the U.S. Congress of its intent to sign a trade agreement with the Middle Eastern Sultanate of Oman. On January 19, 2006, the two countries signed the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement (OFTA), which was part of the Bush administration's strategy to create a US - Middle East Free Trade Area (MEFTA) by 2013. On June 29, 2006, the U.S. Senate passed OFTA by a vote of 60–34, the fewest \"aye\" votes in the Senate of any trade bill other than CAFTA. On July 20, 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives passed OFTA by a vote of 221–205, with 7 abstentions. For procedural reasons, the Senate took a second vote on September 19, 2006, and the bill's implementing bill was passed 62–32, with 6 abstentions.Senate roll call vote In all, the Senate approved the bill 63–37, since all senators voted either \"aye\" or \"nay\" in one of the two votes. President Bush signed the bill into law on September 26, 2006.Kuwait News Agency story And on December 29, 2008, signed the proclamation to implement the agreement with effective date of January 1, 2009. ===Qatar=== President Bush visited Qatar in June 2003, where he met with Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. then Visited U.S. Central Command headquarters and addressed U.S. military personnel, becoming the first U.S. president to visit the country. ===Saudi Arabia=== President Bush had close and strong relations with senior members of the Saudi Royal Family. Saudi Arabia engaged the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Patton Boggs as registered foreign agents in the wake of the public relations disaster when knowledge of the identities of suspected hijackers became known. They also hired the PR and lobbying firm Qorvis for $14 million a year. Qorvis engaged in a PR frenzy that publicized the \"9/11 Commission finding that there was 'no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded [Al Qaeda]'—while omitting the report's conclusion that 'Saudi Arabia has been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism.'\" According to at least one journalist (John R. Bradley), the ruling Saudi family was caught between depending for military defense on the United States, while also depending for domestic support on the Wahhabi religious establishment, which as a matter of religious doctrine \"ultimately seeks the West's destruction\", including that of its ruler's purported ally—the US. During the Iraq War, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, criticized the U.S.-led invasion as a \"colonial adventure\" aimed only at gaining control of Iraq's natural resources. But at the same time, Bradley writes, the Saudi government secretly allowed the US military to \"essentially\" manage its air campaign and launch special operations against Iraq from inside Saudi borders, using \"at least three\" Saudi air bases. The two nations cooperated and shared information about al-Qaeda (Alsheikh 2006) and leaders from both countries continue to meet to discuss their mutual interests and bilateral relations. Saudi Arabia and the U.S. are strategic allies, ===Syria=== Bush expanded economic sanctions on Syria. In 2003, Bush signed the Syria Accountability Act, which expanded sanctions on Syria. In May 2004, a new comprehensive set of economic sanctions were enacted under the Bush administration by Executive Order 13338. Overall, There were a total of seven of executive orders enacted by President Bush to implement sanctions on Syria, which include Executive Orders 13315, 13224, 13382, 13338, 13399, 13441, and 13460. These sanctions are imposed on certain Syrian citizens or entities due to their participation in terrorism, acts of public corruption, or their destabilizing activities in Iraq and Lebanon. In early 2007, the Treasury Department, acting on a June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and Calibration Laboratory. Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction\"U.S. Treasury moves to clamp down on Syrian entities accused of spreading weapons\". Registration required. January 4, 2007. Retrieved June 23, 2009. and being supportive of terrorism. Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to \"undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon\" in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad. ===United Arab Emirates=== According to Richard A. Clarke, then US National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-terrorism and a contributor in the 9/11 Commission Report, the UAE is the United States best counter-terrorism ally in the Gulf. According to previous US ambassador to UAE Richard G. Olson, Deputy Commander of the UAE Armed Forces Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan structured the UAE Armed forces to be closely aligned with the US military. The United Arab Emirates Armed Forces is the only Arab country to commit military troops for humanitarian aid missions in the US-led War in Afghanistan when it deployed its forces of 170 soldiers serving in Tarin Kowt province in March 2008. ==Oceania== ===Australia=== Following the September 11 attacks, in which eleven Australian citizens were also killed, there was an enormous outpouring of sympathy from Australia for the United States. Prime Minister John Howard became one of Bush's strongest international supporters, and supported the United States in the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 by invoking the ANZUS treaty and the invasion of Iraq in 2003, by deploying Australian forces in both wars. In 2004 the Bush administration \"fast tracked\" a free trade agreement with Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald called the deal a \"reward\" for Australia's contribution of troops to the Iraq invasion. ===New Zealand=== Relations with New Zealand under the Bush administration improved and became increasingly closer especially after Prime Minister Helen Clark visited the White House on March 22, 2007. Following the 9/11 attacks, Prime Minister Clark contributed New Zealand military forces to the War in Afghanistan. ==Sub-Saharan Africa== Time stated that Africa is the \"triumph of American foreign policy\" and is the \"Bush Administration's greatest achievement\".Adewale Banjo, \"US development diplomacy in Africa: From Bill Clinton to George W. Bush\". African Journal of Political Science and International Relations 4.4 (2010): 140-149Nicolas Van de Walle, \"US policy towards Africa: The Bush legacy and the Obama administration\". African Affairs 109.434 (2010): 1-21 https://doi.org/10.1093/afraf/adp065 ===Humanitarian aid=== President Bush worked to reduce the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Africa, stop the spread of malaria, and rebuild broken nations from their genocidal pasts. One of the most notable programs initiated by Bush is the PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) Program, which was a commitment of $15 billion over five years (2003–2008) from the United States to fight the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. As of September 2007, the program estimated that it had supported the provision of antiretroviral treatment to approximately 1,445,500 people, mostly in Africa. Alternate Delegate to the United Nations Kelly Craft advised the US Ambassador to the UN on US engagement in Africa. Craft also gave a speech to the UN General Assembly on the investment the U.S. and other nations were making to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa and malaria in Africa, and promote development there. Bush also initiated programs that put more than 29 million of Africa's poorest children into schools. Bush provided \"huge overt support\" in Liberia to stabilize the country, and increasingly effective aid and trade backing good governance have helped improve health and provide education, skills, and jobs on the continent. He also supported agricultural independence in Africa, reducing Chinese mercantilism on the continent that had been overwhelming the farmers. \"Beninese\" cotton farmers urged him to \"stand fast on his opposition to the pork-belly politics of the farm bill that is winding its disgraceful way through Congress\" on his last visit to Africa. Finally, he was steadfast in changing the Doha round of World Trade Organization talks so it will favor the poor in Africa. ===Sudan/Darfur conflict=== On October 13, 2006, President Bush signed the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act imposing sanctions against people responsible for genocide and war crimes in Sudan. It enables the Bush administration to deny Sudan's government access to oil revenues. Furthermore, to the signing of the law, Bush signed another executive order that confirms the existing sanctions but eases some on parts of southern Sudan. It also includes exceptions to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid to Darfur. On the other side the order toughens some sanctions, including a provision that bars any American from engaging in oil- related transactions in Sudan. The order comes as the Bush administration's new special envoy for Sudan, Andrew Natsios, began a trip to Sudan, where he plans to meet with government officials and visit war-torn Darfur. In response to the Government of Sudan's continued complicity in unabated violence occurring in Darfur, Bush imposed new economic sanctions on Sudan in May 2007. These sanctions blocked assets of Sudanese citizens implicated in the Darfur violence, and also sanctioned additional companies owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan. Sanctions continue to underscore U.S. efforts to end the suffering of the millions of Sudanese affected by the crisis in Darfur. Sudan has often accused the U.S. of threatening its territorial integrity by supporting referendums in the South and in Darfur. ===Zimbabwe=== In March 2003, President Bush issued an executive order, where he imposed targeted sanctions on the Government of Zimbabwe, including financial and visa measures, sanctions against selected individuals including Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and 76 other high-ranking government officials, a ban on transfers of defence items and services, and a suspension of non- humanitarian government-to-government assistance. \"Over the course of more than two years, the government of Zimbabwe has systematically undermined that nation's democratic institutions, employing violence, intimidation, and repressive means including legislation to stifle opposition to its rule\", Bush said in the order. Bush also said the situation in Zimbabwe \"endangers the southern African region\" and threatens to undermine democratic reforms throughout the continent. Despite strained political relations, the United States continued as a leading provider of humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe, providing about $400,000,000 in humanitarian assistance from 2002 to 2007, most of it being food aid. In January 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice of the Bush administration identified Zimbabwe as one of the states in outposts of tyranny due to the Zimbabwean Government of Robert Mugabe's increased assault on human rights and the rule of law. In July 2008, President Bush signed another executive order to widen the sanctions against individuals and organizations in Zimbabwe associated with what he calls the \"illegitimate\" regime of President Robert Mugabe after the controversial 2008 Zimbabwean general election. ==See also== * List of international presidential trips made by George W.

It encompassed the High and Late Middle Ages of the Old World, the Islamic Golden Age and the period of Renaissance, followed by the early modern period, characterized by the European wars of religion, the Age of Enlightenment, the Age of Discovery and the colonial period. Its final two centuries coincide with modern history, characterized by industrialization, the rise of nation states, the rapid development of science, widespread education, and universal health care and vaccinations in the developed world. The 20th century saw increasing globalization, most notably the two World Wars and the subsequent formation of the United Nations. 20th-century technology includes powered flight, television and semiconductor technology, including integrated circuits. The term \"Great Divergence\" was coined to refer the unprecedented cultural and political ascent of the Western world in the second half of the millennium, emerging by the 18th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization, having eclipsed Qing China, the Islamic world and India. This allowed the colonization by European countries of much of the world during this millennium, including the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and South and Southeast Asia. World population grew without precedent over the millennium, from about 310 million in 1000 to about 6 billion in 2000. The population growth rate increased dramatically during this time; world population approximately doubled to 600 million by 1700, and doubled more than three more times by 2000, ultimately reaching about 1.8% per year in the second half of the 20th century. ==Political history== ===Middle Ages=== ;Europe *Western/Central Europe **Kingdom of Scotland (843–1707): see Medieval Scotland ** Kingdom

beginning of the millennium, and all countries that once used the Julian calendar had adopted the Gregorian calendar by the end of it. For this reason, the end date of the 2nd millennium is usually calculated based on the Gregorian calendar, while the beginning date is based on the Julian calendar (or occasionally the proleptic Gregorian calendar). In the late 1990s, there was a dispute as to whether the millennium should be taken to end on December 31, 1999, or December 31, 2000. Stephen Jay Gould at the time argued there is no objective way of deciding this question.Stephen Jay Gould, Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown (New York: Harmony Books, 1999), ch 2. Associated Press reported that the third millennium began on 1 January 2001, but also reported that celebrations in the US were generally more subdued at the beginning of 2001, compared to the beginning of 2000.Associated Press, \"Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party\", Los Angeles Times, January 1, 2001. Many public celebrations for the end of the second millennium were held on December 31, 1999 – January 1, 2000—with a few people marking the end of the millennium a year later. ==Centuries and decades== 11th century 1000s 1010s 1020s 1030s 1040s 1050s 1060s 1070s 1080s 1090s 12th century 1100s 1110s 1120s 1130s 1140s 1150s 1160s 1170s 1180s 1190s 13th century 1200s 1210s 1220s 1230s 1240s 1250s 1260s 1270s 1280s 1290s 14th century 1300s 1310s 1320s 1330s 1340s 1350s 1360s 1370s 1380s 1390s 15th century 1400s 1410s 1420s 1430s 1440s 1450s 1460s 1470s 1480s 1490s 16th century 1500s 1510s 1520s 1530s 1540s 1550s 1560s 1570s 1580s 1590s 17th century 1600s 1610s 1620s 1630s 1640s 1650s 1660s 1670s 1680s 1690s 18th century 1700s 1710s 1720s 1730s 1740s 1750s 1760s 1770s 1780s 1790s 19th century 1800s 1810s 1820s 1830s 1840s 1850s 1860s 1870s 1880s 1890s 20th century 1900s 1910s 1920s 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 21st century 2000s 2010s 2020s 2030s 2040s 2050s 2060s 2070s 2080s 2090s ==References== Category:Millennia\n",

      "Guarantor of the imperial constitution[SEP]The guarantors of the imperial constitution or guarantor powers were those states that were, by treaty, obligated to defend the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire. The three guarantor powers were Sweden, France and Russia. The role of the guarantors was first defined in the Peace of Westphalia (24 October 1648) that ended the Thirty Years' War, specifically in Article 17 of the Treaty of Osnabrück with Sweden and Article 16 of the Treaty of Münster with France. In 1779, Russia became the third guarantor power through Article 12 of the Treaty of Teschen (13 May) that ended the War of the Bavarian Succession.Karl Otmar Freiherr von Aretin, \"Russia as a Guarantor Power of the Imperial Constitution under Catherine II\", Journal of Modern History 58, Supplement (1986): S141–S160. ==Powers== Although the use of external or third-party guarantors was not unusual in treaties at the time, the original Westphalian guarantors (Sweden and France) were parties to the treaties. Nonetheless, since most clauses in the treaties dealt with the inner workings of the Empire, it is common to regard Sweden and France as external guarantors. In fact, as parties to the treaties, the emperor and the imperial estates were also guarantors, although their status as such was generally ignored in theoretical discussions of the treaties and the guarantees.Patrick Milton, \"Guarantee and Intervention: The Assessment of the Peace of Westphalia in International Law and Politics by Authors of Natural Law and of Public Law, c. 1650–1806\", in Simone Zurbuchen (ed.), The Law of Nations and Natural Law, 1625–1800, Vol. 1 (Leiden: Brill, 2019), pp. 186–226. According to the imperial jurist Johann Jakob Moser, the guarantee in the treaties of Westphalia could be used by anyone, \"natives or foreigners, members of the Empire or not, whoever directly or indirectly is injured according to the Treaty of Westphalia.\" Karl von Aretin argues that although the guarantor power \"seemed to open the door to intervention in the politics of the Empire ... it turned out that politics based on the guarantee of peace in the Treaty of Westphalia forced the guarantor powers as well to pursue a politics of peace and legality in the sense of the Imperial Constitution.\" The actual formal use of the guarantor power required following a complicated series of steps. Patrick Milton argues that \"by placing the confessional rights of religious groups under international guarantee, the Peace of Westphalia and its guarantee clauses helped to establish the principle of internationally guaranteed minority rights as a part of the positive law of nations.\" ==History== thumb|left|upright|Cardinal Mazarin, French statesman Cardinal Richelieu first conceived the idea of a French peace guarantee as a form of collective security during the War of the Mantuan Succession (1628–1631). It was envisioned as a substitute for the emperor's feudal suzerainty in imperial Italy, but France lost the war and had to accept the continuance of imperial suzerainty. In 1648, Richelieu's successor, Cardinal Mazarin, acquired a guarantor power expressly to uphold the Empire. The high point of the French exercise of the power came in 1658 when the League of the Rhine was formed as a counterweight to the imperial prerogative. After the death of Mazarin in 1661, King Louis XIV overplayed his hand, alienated the members of the League and allowed the Emperor Leopold I to regain some of his authority and prestige.Joachim Whaley, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire, Volume II: The Peace of Westphalia to the Dissolution of the Reich, 1648–1806 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), pp. 11–12. The decline of France's guarantor power began with its invasion of the Spanish Netherlands, legally a part of the Empire, in 1667.Whaley (2012), p. 27. A turning point was the invasion of the Dutch Republic in 1672. Louis XIV declared that, since the Republic lay outside the Empire, any assistance given to such an enemy of France by the Empire or its members was a violation of the Peace of Westphalia and of the guarantee. Thereafter, France was no longer perceived as the protector of German liberties. The beginning of the Eternal Diet, the perpetual session of the imperial diet after 1663, hastened the decline of France's standing in the Empire, since the diet provided an internal mechanism for settling disputes. In a dispute between the Electoral Palatinate and its neighbours led by the Electorate of Mainz—the so-called Wildfangstreit of 1660–1674—the former called upon Sweden and France to intervene on its behalf as guarantors. thumb|upright|Nikolay Rumyantsev, Russian envoy The Peace of Westphalia and the guarantor power were renewed in the subsequent treaties of Nijmegen (1679), Ryswick (1697), Rastatt (1714) and, to Russia's benefit, Teschen (1779). Russian interest in a role in the Empire began with Tsar Peter the Great as early as 1710. In January 1778, an opportunity presented itself to Catherine the Great when King Frederick II of Prussia requested her mediation in a dispute over Bavaria. In a letter of 3 February, Frederick claimed that Russia would certainly become a guarantor of the Empire if Catherine intervened to help him. Russia's aim was to become a guarantor with rights in the Empire and not to help Prussia. To this end, Catherine moderated Prussian aims, resulting a treaty unexpectedly favourable to Austria. By 1781, a diplomatic revolution had taken place. Gone was the Russo-Prussian alliance, replaced by a new Austro-Russian alliance. The guarantor system of Westphalia had also been transformed. Russia, which had defeated Sweden in the Great Northern War (1721), effectively usurped its place as guarantor. The first Russian envoy to the empire in its capacity as a guarantor was Nikolay Rumyantsev, who arrived in 1782. Russia's last major intervention as a guarantor was in favour of the princes' league in the autumn of 1794. Catherine wrote a letter praising the league as an act of imperial patriotism. The league never came to fruition. After Catherine's death in 1796, the Russian court took little interest in exercising its guarantor powers, although Tsar Paul I claimed a right to be consulted on all imperial questions. During the French Revolutionary Wars, the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801) renewed Westphalia and the guarantor clause.Whaley (2012), p. 635. On 5 March 1804, French troops entered imperial territory to arrest Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, who was tried and executed on 21 March. Sweden and Russia, as guarantors, demanded that the Emperor Francis II respond to the blatant violation of imperial sovereignty, but the emperor refused.Whaley (2012), p. 633. Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France since 1804, dispensed with the renewal of the guarantor clause in the treaties of Schönbrunn (1805) and Pressburg (1805). Thereafter he acted as arbiter of the Empire's fate rather than guarantor of its constitution until its final dissolution in August 1806.Whaley (2012), p. 635. ==References== Category:Law of the Holy Roman Empire Category:France–Holy Roman Empire relations Category:Holy Roman Empire–Sweden relations Category:Holy Roman Empire–Russia relations\n",

      "Sidney J. A. Churchill[SEP]Sidney John Alexander Churchill (1 March 186211 January 1921), often referred to as Sidney J. A. Churchill, was a British diplomat, art connoisseur and author. == Life == thumb|Sidney J A Churchill self-portrait He was born in Iași, United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia on 1 March 1862 the son of Henry Adrian Churchill (182886), who was an archaeologist and British diplomat, and Marie Braniefska (?1839-1905). Three of his four brothers Harry Lionel (18601924), William Algernon (18651947), and George Percy (18761973) were also diplomats.Foreign Office Statement of Service 1926 In 1908 he married Stella Myers who qualified as a doctor at Girton College, Cambridge and went on to become a writer and lecturer on health questions, and a trong supporter of the Save the Children Fund.

They had a son, George (born 1910), and a daughter, Ruth (191288), an architect who studied church architecture in pre-war Romania and then travelled extensively in Ethiopia. She documented her 20-year research in the local churches in Architecture of the Tigre, Ethiopia.

      "Domestic drama[SEP]Domestic drama expresses and focuses on the realistic everyday lives of middle or lower classes in a certain society, generally referring to the post- Renaissance eras. According to the English Communications Syllabus, domestic drama refers to a dramatic story containing an emphasis on its “characters' intimate relationships and their responses to [the] unfolding events in their lives.” The characters, their lives, and the events that occur within the show are usually classified as 'ordinary' events, lives, and characters, but this does not limit the extent of what domestic drama can represent. Domestic drama does, however, take the approach in which it “concerns people much like ourselves, taken from the lower and middle classes of society, who struggle with everyday problems such as poverty, sickness, crime, and family strife.”a domestic drama is a drama that is usually being used in comedy. ==Roots== Domestic is derived from the Latin domus, or home. The word domestic is defined as “of or relating to the household.” Drama receives the definition of “A prose or verse composition, especially one telling a serious story, that is intended for representation by actors impersonating the characters and performing the dialogue and action,” and it is derived from the Greek word drao, to act or to take action. The combination of both domestic and drama provides a literal translation of “a serious story relating to the household,” clearly a synonymous definition to the given definition provided by the English Communications Syllab ==Development and History== Dramatic works have nearly always contained a sense of domestic drama within its fundamental plot line. Even in the early ages of Greek drama, there has been a sense of ordinary people's struggles with their lives (though this cannot be classified as domestic drama due to the incorporation of the Greek gods interfering with the common people and the enabling of the common people to have “godlike” attributes). Medieval theatre tended to express religious themes within their shows with miracles and the creation of morality plays, in which the shows were used as religious allegories. Though not yet emphasizing the ordinary lives, the development of dramatic works is slowly working towards more realistic plot lines, one of the essential elements in domestic drama. Renaissance theatre marks the arrival of pastoral drama, drama referring to the relationships of the rustics. Though this describes the events of 'ordinary people', the shows tended to stretch realism, focussed mainly on the romantic relationships of the rustics, and were decorated with an emphasis on the comedic aspect of theater. Pastoral drama was considered to be more successful than the traditional comedies and tragedies, enforcing the further development into domestic drama. Drama in the late seventeenth century consisted of neoclassical comedies focusing on the comedic relationships within the upper classes. This era also consisted of the Restoration drama and placed an emphasis on the usage of poetic language, “sensational incidents, and epic personages” within the show. These styles of shows are not considered domestic dramas because they focus on the relationships of the higher classes, as opposed to the middle or lower classes. This further develops into domestic drama as the plot lines become more realistic and centered around characters' relationships and their actions towards each other. The eighteenth century marks the arrival of domestic drama as the shows start focusing on the problems of the ordinary people. The early eighteenth century playwrights used domestic drama to express the “trend toward sentimental bourgeois realism.” These new domestic dramas also incorporated realistic comedies of fairly sophisticated characterizations [with] middle-class morality. These early domestic dramas are classified as part of the Romantic era of all types of arts. left|thumb|170px|Portrait of a younger Henrik Ibsen, one of the first playwrights to adapt domestic drama into his works.Nineteenth century drama took the complete step in incorporating realism into drama, thus resulting in more serious and philosophical drama. Characters and settings gradually developed into the realistic truths of the current society. Along with realism was naturalism: “selective realism emphasizing the more sordid and pessimistic aspects of life.” This movement of combined realism and naturalism gave way to the “slice-of-life” shows commonly synonymous with domestic drama. One outstanding playwright of this era was Henrik Ibsen of Norway. His frequent usage of realism within his shows “brought to a climax the realistic movement of the nineteenth century and also served as a bridge to twentieth century symbolism.”Columbia University Press via answers.com, section 7 paragraph 5 Ibsen used middle-class characters dealing with his complex plots and “surpassed other such works” of his time. Playwrights such as Ibsen have drawn much attention to domestic drama and have brought this method to its high significant stature in modern theatrical works. The twentieth century introduced symbolism into the makings of domestic dramas, ultimately causing variations within domestic drama. Early twentieth century shows incorporated such psychological devices as “minimal scenery, telegraphic dialogue, talking machines, and characters portrayed as types rather than individuals.”Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 2 Domestic drama suddenly became a combination of naturalism, expressionism, symbolism, and commonly used psychological affairs. The classification of domestic dramas became unclear as shows challenged new ideas and created a difficulty in determining the illusions and realism of a show. Modern dramas usually revolve around psychological, social, and political affairs, all of which seem to have their roots in domestic drama. Modern works also use interpretive ideas, such as “distinctive voice and vision, stark settings, austere language in spare dialog, meaningful silences, the projection of a powerful streak of menace, and outbursts of real or implied violence.”Columbia University Press via answers.com section 8 paragraph 9 The utensils of dramatic works have greatly expanded, but all still carry the roots of domestic drama. Domestic drama also carries the implications of current affairs with society: such as civil rights, feminism, and current political and sociological disputes. Current domestic drama itself tends to express the “war-at-home” style of theater, whereas twentieth century domestic drama could be classified as experimental theater or symbolic theater. ==Audience Appeal== Domestic drama tends to appeal to the audience because most of the audience can relate to the events within a domestic drama. The audience is appealed to this style of drama in four ways: empathy, humor, suspense, and resolution of the issues. This group of spectators can empathize with the domestic drama at hand because the domestic drama touches incidents that are common to the 'ordinary' people. Many playwright use the audience's empathy to manipulate the proposed expression of the show. David Williamson's “Brilliant Lies” uses “domestic unit battling” to create sympathy from the audience as they are confronted with the issue. Humor provides the entertainment value within a domestic drama as these usually touch base with serious matters. The entertainment value of a show keeps the people engaged without having to continually use serious turns of events in order to maintain an audience's interest. Suspense provides “dramatic irony” as the audience indulges itself within the characters' situation and privacy of their backgrounds. Suspense is used in a domestic drama in order for the audience to react with the characters of the show. This “[positions] the audience to feel privileged and therefore involved with the unfolding drama.” As in all shows, an audience expects a resolution to the conflict within a show. Domestic dramas drive the show to its resolution to keep the audience desiring to reach the climax. Domestic dramas use such a technique that is very similar to the style of modern soap operas. ==Text== The text of a domestic drama follows a specific guideline in order to stay within this genre: subject, structure, and language. By deviating from this guideline too excessively, the classification as a domestic drama becomes problematic. The subject of a domestic drama must be that of the 'ordinary' people. The audience (generally 'ordinarily') needs to connect with the characters of the domestic drama, and the plot must the following the “domestic sphere” of “traditional families, urban family units, or domestic households.” The subject of the domestic drama could also apply to relationships at a workplace as this does relate to the 'ordinary' events of 'ordinary' people. The subjects of concern could vastly range from poverty to family strife, from civil rights to economic injustices. Due to the audience relationship with the material of the domestic drama, most domestic dramas are most successful in the society in which the plot is direct towards because the audience is most familiar with the culture of the show. Domestic dramas follow a fairly linear structure and generally have a sort of patriarchal figure as a representative of the family. This patriarchal figure provides the guidelines of the everyday nature of the subjects of the show. Confrontations with the patriarchal figure are also a common structure within domestic dramas. The language used in a domestic drama generally relates with the 'ordinary' subjects of a show to reinforce the “realistic impression” of the show onto and audience. The usage of a specific language enables a specific audience to further connect with the subjects of the domestic drama as language is an “intimate personal way of communicating.” ==Social expression== Theater has been commonly used as a public expression of the humanitarian affairs of a certain era. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth era, drama expressed the ideals of the caste and court system, with nobility on high and rustics down low. This expression gave way to the public in order to see and understand how this system was to work within their society. Some might say that theater has played a very important role in the shaping of societies when used in this way. Nineteenth century induced the importance of the middle-class within drama and introduced the role of the bourgeois and the usage of aristocratic entertainment. The political aspects of a certain era were inevitably present within these shows, especially shows leading towards domestic drama. Theater was considered to have “good [socially] position” characters against the immoral acts of society, usually a sort of infringement against a certain code of behavior. Theater was the way to explain the rights and wrongs of a certain lifestyle in a society, especially if the characters were of the 'ordinary' people so that the audience could relate with the characters. Modern drama changed this aspect of theater as it was not directed towards any one class in society, but rather the collaboration of the artistic aspects within these classes. Such a combination created much difficulty in domestic drama as domestic drama appeals to a specific class. ==Sources== #Domestic Drama by Maddy Ritchard and Anna Forward #Encyclopædia Britannica 15th Edition (2007) ==External links== *A review of domestic drama Category:Drama\n",

      "Episodic storytelling[SEP]Episodic storytelling is a genre of narrative that is divided into a fixed set of episodes. Multiple episodes are usually grouped together into a series through a unifying story arc, with the option to view immediately (rather than waiting for the release of each episode). Episodes may not always contain the same characters, but each episode draws from a broader group of characters, or cast, all of whom exist in the same story world. It is one of the most common form of storytelling in tv film. The term used in literature to refer to a body of written work (such as novels by Charles Dickens) that initially appears in installments, is traditionally referred to as serials. The genre has resurfaced in popularity due to the influence of new digital technologies, such as virtual reality and streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and YouTube Premium. ==See also== * Webserial * Feuilleton * Television series ==References== Category:Narrative units Category:Continuity (fiction) Category:Fiction Category:Narratology Category:Plot (narrative)\n",

      "The Guarani[SEP]The Guarani: Brazilian Romance () is a 1857 Brazilian novel written by José de Alencar. It was first serialized in the newspaper Diário do Rio de Janeiro, but due to its enormous success Alencar decided to compile his writing in a volume. A plausible explanation for this success might be in the fact that the novel spoke of freedom and independence, arguing for a nativeness that could be found in tropical nature and in the indigenous people of Brazil. Years later the novel was turned into an opera performed in Italian and called Il Guarany (1870), by Carlos Gomes, among other places it was presented in Milan and New York (it is a known fact that the author did not appreciate the final result). The Guarani is regarded a foundational text of Brazilian Romanticism, but it gained international projection by being translated into Spanish, German (Der Guarany, Brasilianischer Roman, Maximillian Emerich, 1876) and English (The Guarany, Brazilian novel, James W. Hawes, 1893). The novel is still widely read nowadays, especially at Brazilian schools as an introduction to novel reading, but also by anyone who enjoys a thrilling adventure story. Literary criticism has tended to link The Guarani to the works of Fenimore Cooper, Chateaubriand and the noble savage from the Rousseauian tradition. However, this interpretation of the novel has become outdated as recent academic works show also how dark, sexual, gothic and lyrical (over narrative, unlike the Fenimore Cooper model) the novel is. Serravalle de Sá, Daniel, Tropical Gothic. Rome: Aracne, 2010. ==Plot introduction== The Guarani is set back in 1604, a period when Portugal and its colonies submitted to Spanish dominion due to a lack of heirs to ascend to the throne. Alencar takes advantage of this dynastic complication to resurrect the historical figure of Dom Antônio de Mariz, one of the founders of the city of Rio de Janeiro and a pioneer settler. This historical (factual) background, which orients the novel throughout, is set in the first two chapters; then fantasy, both violent and erotic, starts to prevail. D. Antônio establishes himself in a deserted inland region, a few days’ travel from the seaside city of Rio. The land was granted to him through his services to the Portuguese crown, whose legitimacy the nobleman now distrusts. To be politically independent (if not economically) and keep to the Portuguese codes of honour, he builds a castle-like house to shelter his family in Brazilian soil where he lives like a feudal lord with his family and retainers. His family consists of his severe wife D. Lauriana, his angelic fair, blue-eyed daughter Cecília, his dandyish son D. Diogo and the \"niece\" Isabel, a cabocla who is in fact his illegitimate daughter by an Indian woman. Other people are also attached to his household: a few loyal servants, forty adventurers/mercenaries kept for protection, the young nobleman Álvaro de Sá, an appropriate suitor for his lawful daughter Cecília, and Peri, an Indian of the Goitacá people, who once saved Cecy’s life (as the romantic/romanticised Indian endearingly calls Cecília) and who has since deserted his tribe and family. Peri is the hero who gives title to the book, he is treated as a friend by D. Antônio and Ceci and as a nuisance by Mrs. Mariz and Isabel. The life of the characters is altered by the arrival of the adventurer Loredano (former friar Angelo di Lucca) who insinuates himself into the house and soon starts subverting the other vassals, planning to kidnap Cecília and scheming against the house of Mariz; along with the accidental murder of an Aimoré Indian woman by D. Diogo. == Comic adaptations == The Guarani is the Brazilian novel with the largest number of adaptations for comics.Cirne, Moacy (January 24, 2011) Quadrinhos - Nos braços de Peri .

      "From the Noble Savage to the Noble Revolutionary[SEP]From the Noble Savage to the Noble Revolutionary (Spanish: Del buen salvaje al buen revolucionario) is a book published in 1976 by Venezuelan writer Carlos Rangel that seeks to explore a new interpretation of the reality of Latin America far from and opposed to, what the author considers to be, myths spread and little questioned about the Latin American identity promoted mostly by the region's nationalists and socialists and that even has been exported as image to the rest of the world. The book has had over sixteen editions in Spanish and has been translated into English, French, Italian, Portuguese and German. The prologue was written by French thinker Jean-François Revel.Del buen salvaje al buen revolucionario. Nota del SVI. The epilogue, on the occasion of the book's thirtieth anniversary in 2006, was in written by the Cuban political analyst Carlos Alberto Montaner. == Summary == === Objecting the myth of the noble savage === The main myth that Rangel seeks to rebut is what he identifies as an adapted version of the myth of the noble savage and the Golden Age - Old World myths - in which Latin Americans would be good people but corrupted by the western society that has destroyed their original values and from which it will be necessary to liberate themselves through revolutions that separate Latin America from the West and reestablish a lost identity different from the Western one.Dos resúmenes del libro similares en su aproximación pueden verse en A 30 años Del buen salvaje al buen revolucionario, publicado por CEDICE (el enlace disponible es del Instituto Independiente); y en Un clásico del liberalismo - Del buen salvaje al buen revolucionario de Aníbal Romero en los suplementos de Libertad Digital. According to Rangel, this mythology would be the result of a compensatory process in the face of the historical failure of the Hispano-American nations in the face of the progress of the European and North American nations, which in some cases started from the same or worse conditions. Transforming a previous society into another requires time and the Meso and South American societies have the challenge of achieving it. === Rejection of Latin American victimism === The author uses analysis in the field of history, psychology and philosophy in the book. Rangel does not deny that Latin America has suffered abuses throughout history; what he rejects is the nationalist victimism that transfers all blame for underdevelopment to other nations and the existence of a Latin American identity different from the West. === Criticism of the \"noble revolutionary\" === For Rangel, the mistaken vision of Latin America as a victim of the developed world and the wealthy classes has forged a stock character, the \"noble revolutionary\", who promotes populism, protectionism, caudillismo and authoritarianism as a solution for the region \"in revenge\" for the abused received by Westerners and whose outbursts must be excused in the name of his \"noble cause\". For the author, the revolution, populism and idolatry of the state of the Latin American \"noble revolutionary\" are nothing more than the continuation of the ills that already existed in pre-Columbian societies, the colony and the nineteenth-century republics; as such, said path would not correct but rather aggravate that heritage. === Defense of the West: Spanish America === Carlos Rangel argues in favor of Western values hated by the \"noble revolutionary\" which, according to the book, are foolishly blamed for the ills of the Hispano-American nations. For the author, the solution to Latin America's stagnation - which Rangel prefers to call Spanish America - is the approachment to the West, of which it is part, through liberalism and its values favorable to individual sovereignty, equality before the law, private property, and freedom without conditions, and that this path would be the one that leads to prosperity as Western society demonstrates. == Reception == To some critics, Rangel's book is the antithesis to the book Open Veins of Latin America published in 1971 by Eduardo Galeano, an icon of the Latin American left-wing. The theoretical and ideological positions of the book caused great controversy at the time. In 1976, in the year of its publication, detractors of his ideas publicly burned copies of the book at the Central University of Venezuela. == See also == * Guide to the Perfect Latin American Idiot == References == == External links == * Del buen salvaje al buen revolucionario - Google Docs Category:1976 essays Category:Venezuelan literature Category:Books about liberalism Category:Essays about politics Category:Spanish essays\n",

      "Liberty and Refoundation[SEP]Liberty and Refoundation (, Libre; libre is the Spanish word for \"free\") is a left-wing political party in Honduras. Libre was founded in 2011 by the National Popular Resistance Front (FNRP), a leftist coalition of organizations opposed to the 2009 coup. Xiomara Castro, the wife of former president Manuel Zelaya who was deposed in the 2009 coup, was the presidential candidate of the party in the 2013 presidential election; Zelaya was not allowed to run for a second term under the constitution. Castro took second place in the four-way race, receiving approximately 29 percent of the vote behind Juan Orlando Hernández's 34 percent.

      "Varela Project[SEP]The Varela Project () is a project that was started in 1998 by Oswaldo Payá of the Christian Liberation Movement (MCL) and named after Felix Varela, a Cuban religious leader. Many members were imprisoned during the Black Spring in 2003. ==The Varela Project citizens' initiative== The purpose of the Varela Project was to circulate a proposal of law advocating for democratic political reforms within Cuba, such as the establishment of freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free elections, freedom of religion, freedom to start private businesses, and amnesty for political prisoners. About 11,000 Cubans signed the reformist Varela Project citizens' initiative.David Altman, Direct Democracy Worldwide (Cambridge University Press), 2011), p. 112. The US State Department's 2005 report on Cuba in Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (issued in 2006) stated that \"activists reported increased harassment by State Security agents. Authorities arrested and detained Varela activists, confiscated signatures, fined and threatened activists and signers, and forced signers to rescind signatures. State Security impersonated canvassing volunteers and increasingly infiltrated the ranks of activists. In May and June, Oswaldo Paya reported State Security agents visited and pressured more than 50 Varela Project signatories to retract their signatures and denounce the Varela Project activists who had collected their signatures.\" The US State Department's 2004 report on Cuba referred to the Cuban Penal Code concept of \"dangerousness,\" defined as the \"special proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest contradiction of socialist norms.\" The report said that \"If the police decide that a person exhibits signs of dangerousness, they may bring the offender before a court or subject him to therapy or political reeducation\". According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, this provision \"amounted to a subjective criterion used by the Government to justify violations of individual freedoms and due process for persons whose sole crime was to hold a view different from the official view\". The Cuban government refused to consider the petition, and the Cuban National Assembly's Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee suspended its consideration, and responded to the Varela Project with a \"counter-initiative\" to enshrine \"irrevocable socialism\" in the Cuban Constitution. The BBC reported that, over a two-week period, 9 million Cubans took to the streets and 99% of all Cuban citizens signed a petition endorsing the constitutional amendment. The BBC said that many Cubans felt pressured into signing the government's petition. An extraordinary session of the National Assembly unanimously approved the amendment in June 2002. The government closed schools, offices, and factory during the session, and nationally televised the speeches; no mention was made of the Varela Project citizens' initiative during the event. ==Support for Varela Project== The Cuban exile community in the United States was split on the Varela Project. Many hard-liners opposed the project out of fears that a reformist proposal would legitimize the Castro regime, and a radio commentator at Radio Mambi said that he was fired for publicly supporting the project. The Cuban American National Foundation under Jorge Mas Santos, supported the Varela Project.David Adams, Cuban exiles bend toward reform, Tapa Bay Times (August 31, 2005). The Varela Project was lauded by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter when he made a historic visit to Havana in May 2002 and gave a televised address broadcast throughout Cuba.Cuban dissident collects EU prize, BBC News (December 17, 2002).Kevin Sullivan, Carter Urges Democracy for Cuba, Washington Post (May 15, 2002). The European Union awarded Payá the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in December 2002. ==Black Spring (2003)== The Cuban government dismissed the Varela Project and its petition. The Cuban government said that the project was part of a \"counterrevolutionary\" plot and \"strategy of subversion against Cuba\" orchestrated by the United States and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. In March 2003, Cuba arrested 75 human rights activists and dissidents, including 25 members of the Varela Project, on a variety of charges. The dissidents were sentenced in public trials to prison terms of between 6 and 28 years for \"mercenary activities and other acts against the independence or territorial integrity of the state\". Amnesty International said it was concerned that the 75 jailed activists may be prisoners of conscience who were imprisoned for their non-violent advocacy for democracy. According to the US State Department, many of those arrested had no access to attorneys until the day of their trial, which was by a judge subordinate to the Communist Party. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern regarding the arrests and summary trials. The US State Department said \"Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia, a Varela Project leader and one of the 75 activists arrested in March 2003, reported serving 45 days in a punishment cell for protesting the suspension of correspondence and the delivery of food and medical supplies from his family. He did not receive food or water during the first 3 days of his confinement and slept on a cement floor. Authorities confiscated his Bible and prohibited any contact with other prisoners. Ferrer was serving a 25 year sentence for \"acts against the independence or the territorial integrity of the State.\"\" According to the US State Department, \"Fabio Prieto Llorente, one of the 75 activists arrested in March 2003, reported he was held in a small cell with leaky walls and a cement slab for a bed. The cell was infested with rats, frogs, and insects\". The US State Department said \"Yarai Reyes, wife of Normando Hernandez Gonzalez, 1 of the 75 political prisoners arrested in March 2003, reported that prison authorities incited common prisoners to beat her husband\". According to the US State Department \"Barbara Rojo Arias, wife of Omar Ruiz Hernandez, an independent journalist and 1 of the 75 human rights activists arrested in March 2003, reported that her husband was denied access to required medications for his heart condition and stomach problems. The US State Department said \"Oscar Espinosa Chepe, a political prisoner released during the year, reported that prison officials regularly denied him adequate medical treatment during his 20-month incarceration\". The US State Department said that Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet \"was sent to a punishment cell for refusing to eat in the prison cafeteria, wear the uniform of common prisoners, and stand at attention when guards entered his cell. He was not permitted to read, write, or leave his cell to get exercise. In addition, prison authorities refused to accept food and medical supplies brought by Morejon or permit anyone to bring him food. As a result, Biscet found himself on a virtual hunger strike\". ==References== Category:1998 in Cuba Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Cuba Category:Cuban dissidents Category:Society of Cuba Category:Human rights organizations based in Cuba Category:Nonviolent resistance movements\n",

      "Black Spring (Cuba)[SEP]thumb|Cubans protesting in Madrid in 2010 Black Spring refers to the 2003 crackdown on Cuban dissidents. The government imprisoned 75 dissidents, including 29 journalists, as well as librarians, human rights activists, and democracy activists, on the basis that they were acting as agents of the United States by accepting aid from the US government. Although Amnesty International adopted 75 Cubans as prisoners of conscience, according to Cuba \"the 75 individuals arrested, tried and sentenced in March/April 2003 ... who were jailed are demonstrably not independent thinkers, writers or human rights activists, but persons directly in the pay of the US government ... those who were arrested and tried were charged not with criticizing the government, but for receiving American government funds and collaborating with U.S diplomats.\" The crackdown on grassroots activists began on 18 March and lasted two days, coordinated with the US invasion of Iraq for minimum publicity. The crackdown received sharp international condemnation, with critical statements coming from the George W. Bush administration, the European Union, the United Nations and various human rights groups, including Amnesty International. Responding to the crackdown, the European Union imposed sanctions on Cuba in 2003, that were lifted in January 2008. The European Union declared that the arrests \"constituted a breach of the most elementary human rights, especially as regards freedom of expression and political association\". All of the dissidents were eventually released, most of whom were exiled to Spain starting in 2010. == Imprisoned people == thumb|Demonstrators holding up signs of imprisoned people during the Black Spring Manuel Vázquez Portal received the International Press Freedom Award in 2003.

      "Havana Presidential Palace attack (1957)[SEP]The 1957 Havana Presidential Palace attack was a failed assassination attempt on the life of President Fulgencio Batista at the Presidential Palace in Havana, Cuba. The attack began at around 3:30 PM on March 13, 1957, carried out by Menelao Mora, a group of members of the Partido Auténtico, and the student opposition group Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo, but was unsuccessful in its goal of killing Batista. According to one of the group's founding members, Faure Chomón, they were following the golpe arriba strategy and sought to overthrow the government by killing Batista. The same day, a similar attack occurred at the Radio Reloj at the Radiocentro CMQ Building. http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/1957/St_Louis_Post_Dispatch-3-13-1957-1.pdf The plan was to announce Batista's death over Radio Reloj; however, this attack also failed. ==Attack== The plan of attack, as explained by Faure Chomón Mediavilla, was to secure the Presidential Palace by a commando of fifty men (46 participated) and simultaneously support the operation by one hundred men occupying the radio station Radio Reloj at the Radiocentro CMQ Building to announce the death of Batista. The attack on the palace would result in the elimination of Fulgencio Batista. === Presidential Palace attack === At 3:40 pm, the main assault force arrived before the main entrance to the Presidential Palace in two sedans and a delivery truck. They were armed with rifles, submachine guns, pistols, and grenades. All were in shirtsleeves for identification, since suits or uniforms were required for persons within the palace. Twelve government soldiers on guard at the entrance were shot or scattered. Of the 46 attackers, nine were able to reach the second floor of the east wing of the palace, about ten were shot down in the open area before the building and the remainder occupied part of the ground floor. The palace switchboard was disabled with a grenade. Batista's office on the third floor was reached by a group of the rebel force and two of his guards were killed near his desk. Batista himself had retreated to the presidential suite on the top floor where the palace defenders rallied and fired on the attackers both within the palace and the forecourt below. At this point military and police reinforcements arrived while tanks were summoned. The rebels within the palace were forced to retreat, some being killed on the main staircase. Only three escaped the building. The main assault force was to be supported by a group of 100 armed men who would occupy the tallest buildings in the surrounding area of the Presidential Palace (La Tabacalera, the Sevilla Hotel, the Palace of Fine Arts) and, from these positions, support the main force. However, this secondary support operation was not carried out as the militants assigned to capture the buildings hesitated and did not arrive. The attackers spoke in code to frustrate a potential infiltration or a divulging of the attack in any conversation. It had been agreed early on that they would refer to the palace as \"la casa de los tres kilos.\" Although the attackers reached the third floor of the palace, they did not locate or harm Batista. === Radio Reloj attack === thumb|310px|Bullet holes in glass at the Radiocentro CMQ Building The attack at Radio Reloj, located in the Radiocentro CMQ Building at Calle 23 and L in El Vedado, was led by José Antonio Echeverría who was accompanied among others, by Fructuoso Rodríguez, Joe Westbrook, Raúl Diaz Argüelles, and Julio García Olivera. The group departed from a basement apartment located on Calle 19 between Calles B and C towards the Radiocentro CMQ Building in three automobiles, including a delivery truck. At 3:21 PM on March 13, 1957, José Antonio arrived at Radio Reloj and after being announced, read a prepared statement over the radio, announcing Batista's death despite that such an event had not actually happened. > \"People of Cuba, in these moments the dictator Fulgencio Batista has just > been justified. In his own burrow of the Presidential Palace, the people of > Cuba have come to settle accounts. And it is we, the Revolutionary > Directory, who in the name of the Cuban Revolution have given the shot of > grace to this regime of opprobrium. Cubans listening to me. It's just been > removed...\" thumb|300px|Havana Police officers armed with automatic weapons after the attackThe operation failed, Batista was never killed, and the troops guarding the Radio Reloj transmission tower in Arroyo Arenas had knocked down the transmission. José Antonio was shot and killed by police on the corner of November 27 and L, on his way back to the university. Otto Hernández Fernández, the last survivor of the Radio Reloj attack, recalled the events: ===Casualties=== left|thumb|The delivery truck used by the attackers Twenty of the 100 members of Batista's presidential guard were killed. Forty-two rebels participated in the attack against the palace; 34 were from the Partido Autentico, and the rest were from the Student Directory.

Surviving the attack were Angel Eros, Amador Silveriño (driver of the \"Fast Delivery\" truck.), Orlando Manrique, Orlando Lamadrid Velazco, Sergio Pereda Velazco, Santiago Aguero, Manuel Toranzo, Ricardo Olmedo (injured during attack; later shot for attempting to kill Fidel Castro), 40, Faure Chomón, Antonio Castell Valdes, Juan Gualberto Valdes, José M.

Two individuals were under arrest to be tried: Orlando Olmedo Moreno, wounded during the attack, and Efrain Alfonso Liriano. All others connected with the attack either escaped or were killed. === Public Act of Redress === thumb|right|300px|Batista supporters at the public act of redress, April 7, 1957 The public act of redress by the people of Havana for the assault of March 13 on the Presidential Palace took place on April 7, 1957. It was reported that more than 250,000 people attended. === Golpeando Arriba === On January 22, 1959, Fidel Castro explained to journalists gathered in the Copa Room of the Havana Riviera hotel, among other topics, that hitting up, \"golpear arriba,\" was one of the \"false concepts about the revolution\" because \"tyranny is not a man; tyranny is a system (...) We were never supporters of tyrannicide or military coups, [which tended] to inculcate the people a complex of impotence \" A few months earlier Castro had reprimanded Guevara for having signed a pact with Rolando Cubela, Chomon's lieutenant in the DR-13-3 guerrilla in Escambray mountains, the \"Pacto del Pedrero\". The letter is dated in Palma Soriano on December 26, 1958; part of it reads: === Humboldt 7 massacre === The failure of the attacks led to a widespread police crackdown on anti-Batista militants, often involving extrajudicial killings of revolutionaries, regardless of whether they were armed or fighting back. On April 20, 1957, four unarmed DRE revolutionaries who were previously involved in the attack were shot and killed by Havana police as they attempted to flee their apartment safehouse during a raid. The event led to widespread criticism of the police and, after the revolution, resulted in the arrest, trial and execution (1964) of Marcos Rodriguez (Marquitos), another revolutionary who betrayed the four men. ==See also== * Humboldt 7 massacre * Radiocentro CMQ Building * Presidential Palace * Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo * Faure Chomón * José Antonio Echeverría * Rolando Cubela Secades * Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo == Notes == == References == ==Additional reading== :Attack on the Presidential Palace (March 13, 1957) ==External links== :Cuando los universitarios se levantaron contra el gobernante de Cuba (FOTOS) :Revolt in Havana.

      "Alberto Rodriguez (FALN)[SEP]Alberto Rodriguez was a Puerto Rican member of the FALN who received a sentence of 35 years for seditious conspiracy and other charges. He was sentenced in 1985, and incarcerated first at United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg (USP Lewisberg), PA, and later at the federal penitentiary at USP Beaumont, TX. However, he was released early from prison, after President Bill Clinton extended a clemency offer in August 1999. Alberto and 10 other Puerto Rican prisoners were released on September 10, 1999.\"12 Imprisoned Puerto Ricans Accept Clemency Conditions\" by John M. Broder. The New York Times September 8, 1999 ==Early years and personal life== Alberto was born in 1953 in Bronx, New York and was raised in Chicago. While he was in high school he became part of a new generation of Puerto Ricans in the United States who demanded that their history and culture be recognized and joined the Puerto Rican Independence Movement. In the early 1970s Puerto Rican students were using the tactics of sit-ins and civil disobedience, to force the Chicago Board of Education to be more responsive to the needs of Latino students. Alberto entered the University of Illinois, Chicago in 1972, and immediately became involved in student struggles for a Latin American studies program and for recruitment of Latino students. Upon graduation in 1976 he began to work for community programs, such as the Borinqueña Learning Center, which provided opportunities for working adults to pursue educational goals. He also worked in various community organizations including the Workers Rights Center, El Comite Pro-Orientacion Comunal, El Desfile del Pueblo, Latino Cultural Center and the Puerto Rican Cultural Center. At the time of his arrest he was married and the father of two children. ==Seditious conspiracy== When arrested in 1983 Alberto was working as an academic counselor at Northeastern Illinois University and was completing his thesis requirements for a graduate degree from Governors State University. He was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 35 years. Rodriguez and three others were arrested in various locations around Chicago on June 29, 1983. Alberto Rodriguez, Edwin Cortes and Jose Luis Rodriguez were given a $10 million bond while Alejandrina Torres was given a $5 million bond. His first ten months in prison were in solitary confinement, where, he says, \"I had to search within myself to find the spiritual strength to persevere.\" A federal judge found the conditions of confinement too harsh and ordered the federal prison to place both Alberto Rodriguez and Edwin Cortes in general population though in special restrictive conditions. A series of arrests against purported FALN members began in 1977 and culminated around 1985. Rodriguez was never charged with any bombings. During the trial proceedings from 1983 through 1985, he declared his status as prisoner of war, and refused to participate in the proceedings.Prendergast, Alan. End of the Line. Denver Westword, July 12, 1995. Retrieved on November 21, 2008 Alberto Rodriguez was given a 35-year federal sentence for seditious conspiracy and other charges. Among the other convicted Puerto Rican nationalists there were sentences of as long as 90 years in Federal prisons for offenses including seditious conspiracy, possession of unregistered firearms, interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by violence and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a crime. None of those granted clemency were convicted in any of the actual bombings, including Rodriguez. Rather, they had been convicted on a variety of conspiracy charges ranging from conspiracy to make bombs, conspiracy to armed robbery and various firearms violations. They were all convicted for seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to oppose the authority of the Government of the United States in Puerto Rico by force. ==Political prisoner== At the time of their arrest Rodriguez and the others declared themselves to be combatants in an anti-colonial war against the United States to liberate Puerto Rico from U.S. domination and invoked prisoner of war status. They argued that the U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction to try them as criminals and petitioned for their cases to be handed over to an international court that would determine their status. The U.S. Government, however, did not recognize their request. The sentences received by Rodriguez and the other Nationalists were judged to be \"out of proportion to the nationalists' offenses.\" Statistics showed their sentences were almost 20 times greater than sentences for similar offenses by the American population at large. For many years, numerous national and international organizations criticized Rodriguez' incarceration categorizing it as political imprisonment. Peoples Law Office. Puerto Rico. Alberto Rodriguez was finally released from prison on September 10, 1999, after President Bill Clinton extended him clemency. Clinton cited Rev. Desmond Tutu and former President Jimmy Carter as having been influential on his decision to grant Rodriguez the clemency offer.

In the struggle for the independence of Peru, the hero acted as secret emissary carrying messages between the Government of Callao and Lima Patriots by swimming. He was discovered, arrested and subjected to torture and sentenced to death. Despite the torture, he never revealed his mission and willingly swallowed the letters assigned to the mission. The independence of Peru, first declared in Huaura in November 1820 and July 28, 1821 in Lima, had become effective only in Lima and in the north, but Cuzco, the central highlands and south were still under the rule of the royal army. When José de San Martín recognized the little support given to political and military forces, he resigned from the Constituent Congress of Peru, 1822. The congress appointed José de la Riva Agüero as President of the Republic and Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro as Congress President. The royal army, taking advantage of the fact that the patriotic troops were far away, took Lima and members of Congress took refuge in the Real Felipe Fortress in Callao. It is at this stage that José Olaya, a fisherman by trade, did not hesitate to serve as a link between the ships of the squadron Liberator (formed by units of the Republic of Chile) and the soldiers of the patriotic forces (Argentina, Chile and Peru) located in Lima, even if it meant walking across fields and swimming in the sea. Imprisoned by the royal army, he was tortured in order to obtain information about the patriotic forces. José Olaya Balandra was not frightened of pain. He suffered two hundred lashes of the whip and two hundred beatings with sticks, not yielding even after they tore out his nails. Finally, on the morning of June 29, 1823 he uttered the phrase: ==References== Category:People from Lima Category:1823 deaths Category:1782 births Category:People of the Peruvian War of Independence Category:Executed revolutionaries\n",

      "Oscar Espinosa Chepe[SEP]Óscar Manuel Espinosa Chepe (November 29, 1940 – September 23, 2013) was a Cuban economist and dissident. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested, tried and convicted in 2003 as part of a crackdown by the Cuban government nicknamed the \"Black Spring\". He was given a twenty-year sentence on a charge of \"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\", causing Amnesty International to declare him as a prisoner of conscience. ==Background== Espinosa was a graduate of the University of Havana, where he received a degree in economics. He served on Prime Minister Fidel Castro's Economic Advisory Group from 1965 to 1968 before spending fourteen years as the economic adviser at the Cuban embassy in Belgrade, overseeing Cuba's economic and technological cooperation with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. In 1984, he returned to Cuba to work at the National Bank, where he was responsible for trade and tourism. However, throughout the 1980s, Espinosa increasingly disagreed with national economic policy. When he discussed his views with a colleague in 1992, he was demoted, and four years later was fired. Espinosa began to write critiques of Cuban economic policy which he published overseas. He also hosted a radio program titled Charlando con Chepe (\"Chatting with Chepe\") in which he discussed the Cuban economy; the program was carried on the U.S.-funded station Radio Martí. Espinosa was married to independent Cuban journalist Miriam Leiva. ==Arrest and trial== On March 19, 2003, Espinosa was arrested during the Black Spring after security agents reportedly spent 10 hours searching his apartment. At a trial on April 3, 2003, Espinosa was accused of \"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\". Authorities stated that Espinosa had received money from the U.S. government, and that US$13,600 had been discovered sewn into one of his jackets. Espinosa was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested and tried. Following a rejected appeal by Espinosa, the Representative of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Christine Chanet, appealed to President Castro to pardon him. The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush appealed to Castro on Espinosa's behalf, calling on the government to provide treatment for his liver disease. A spokesman described the Cuban government as \"going out of its way\" to be inhumane to its prisoners. Espinosa's wife Leiva reported that he had lost forty pounds since his arrest and was kept in a cell with no windows or running water. Leiva became active in the Ladies in White, a group of wives of political prisoners which marched through Havana each Sunday protesting their husbands' detention. She continued to march even after Espinosa's early release. == Release == Espinosa was released from prison along with fellow writer Raúl Rivero on November 29, 2004, after serving just over 19 months of his prison sentence; It was his sixty-fourth birthday. The authorities granted him medical parole because his already poor health had declined seriously during his incarceration. After his release, he called on the government to release the remaining Black Spring prisoners, stating, \"The government really committed a very big error with us. We are completely peaceful and we want only the reconciliation of Cuban society.\" In 2006, Espinosa stated his opposition to U.S. funding for the Cuban dissident movement, calling it \"counterproductive\" and stating that the Cuban people must solve its own problems. Following Raúl Castro's assumption of the presidency, Espinosa expressed his hope that Castro could be the Deng Xiaoping of Cuba, improving the economy and the standard of living. ==Death== He died of liver disease on September 23, 2013, in Spain. ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Cuba Category:Cuban democracy activists Category:Cuban dissidents Category:Cuban economists Category:Cuban journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:University of Havana alumni Category:Deaths from liver disease Category:Cuban prisoners and detainees\n",

      "Olga Cabrera Hansen[SEP]Olga Delfina Emilia Cabrera Hansen (January 13, 1935) is a distinguished lawyer from the city of Rosario, victim of Argentina's last civilian military dictatorship, human rights activist and a person who worked the most, since the legal field, for the reconstruction of what happened in the clandestine detention center and the Information Service (SI) of the police headquarters of Santa Fe, Argentina, in Rosario during that period (El Pozo de Rosario). ==Description== In September 1975 a bomb exploded in her classroom. A few days before the coup, in February 1976, Hansen's house blew up with another bomb. At the end of 1976,while she was at home with her three children and another person,Eduardo Carafa who was an engineer, and came there for legal works. the Army stopped her car while she wants to go out with her family early in the morning. They were taken in assault cars. They were left her three children in the yard. The oldest was 10 years old at that time. At the Police Headquarters they entered through San Lorenzo Street, and the Fiat that brought it turned left, until it reached the corner of Dorrego. She was bandaged, taken to a place in the clandestine detention center of the Information Service Where she heard crafa's screamed and his torture who was released after 20 days with broken ribs and her eyes damaged by the electric prod. Olga was questioned among others, the police inspector Rosario Agustín Feced and José Rubén Lofiego (known as the blind man), who was the one who armed the information. They put her in a hallway. She spent several days in that place, where she constantly listened to how she was tortured. A few days later, after several interrogations, they went to the basement. At that moment they released her sight. Her eyes burned, because the bandages had been made with posters that were painted with lime. ===Solidarity between peers=== The women who were there receive it, help it, clean it, contain it. Among others were Ana Maria Ferrari, Graciela Villarreal, Roxana Colombo and Adriana Koatz. They took Ana Ferrari every night, they put her up, a Sergeant Vergara was looking for her and they tortured her, the oppressors were particularly angry with Ferrari. Graciela Villarreal was also terribly tortured. Adriana Koatz, was a student of chemical engineering and was a member of the Peronist University Youth when she was arrested on October 21, 1976 and taken to the Information Service. From there she suffered a string of blows, tortures, vexations. She recalls that she shared captivity in the basement with Ester Fernández, Graciela Villarreal, Ana María Ferrari, Olga Cabrera Hansen, among others. Among men she remembers Pérez Risso and Piccolo. She was then referred to Villa Devoto where her father gave her the news that her sister Edith Graciela Koatz had been murdered along with her husband Palmiro Labrador Pérez. After a massive transfer of female detainees to the prisons of Devoto and of men to Coronda, few remained in the basement of the Jefatura. They took them to the Warden. Olga is there until September 1977, without seeing the light or leaving. ===The visit of the International Red Cross=== It happened in February 1977. When the delegation began to ask, Olga could not contain herself. Everyone was silent but she could not and said everything: \"No judge knows I'm here, and this is two blocks from the courthouse, we do not see the sun, we do not have visitors, here we just torture and kill people.\" Afterwards, they told him that he could have left at that moment, but for everything he had said he was going to stay two more years. So it was. ==Testimony== In 2010 began in the Federal Courts, the second oral and public trial for crimes against humanity committed during the last military civic dictatorship in the area of the Great Rosary, in the case known as Diaz Bessone (ex \"Causa Feced).DIAZ BESSONE The case \"Díaz Bessone\" has as imputed a soldier and five civilians, who are accused of carrying out the repression in the clandestine center of the Information section of the Police Headquarters, considered the most important that worked in the city. in the cause are the former commander of the Second Army Corps, Ramón Díaz Bessone, and former policemen Rubén Lofiego, Mario Marcote, Ramón Vergara, José Scortechini and Ricardo Chomicky, the heart of the repressive apparatus that acted under the orders of the deceased former head of the Rosario Police, Agustín Feced. In November 2010, Olga testified in front of the Federal Oral Court: she was not another witness, but someone who embodies the very history of the cause that investigates State terrorism in the region. He recalled that the then chaplain of the police, Eugenio Zitelli, defended the torture in front of detainees. In general, they had all been raped, since it was a systematic practice of the detention center and he recalled that some of the compañeras who were Catholic, asked for spiritual assistance, were frightened by what the priest told them. He justified torture as something to obtain information, but the violation if it outraged him, said that it was immoral. In January 1977, the door opened and María Inés Luchetti de Bettanín arrived with a newborn baby, for whom neither I even had clothes. Among the detainees they made an improvised trousseau with pieces of their own clothes. In addition to pointing to Feced and Lofiego, Olga remembered the presence of Ramón Rito Vergara, aka the Sergeant, in the basement of the SI. In a train to unveil the network of complicities, he mentioned the close relations between his official defender, Laura Cosidoy and Major Fernando Soria, in charge of the war council simulacra in the Second Army Corps Command. One of the most shocking moments was when she told of a detainee, María de la Encarnación García del Villar de Tapia, who had been terribly tortured. She herself told him a dialogue between Lofiego and Feced when they threw her to the side, after the torments. \"He saw commander, how women have a degree of tolerance,\" El Ciego told his superior. He also remembered the Swift workers, among whom there were three pregnant women. From Luisa Marciani, she said she was 40 years old, she was full term and she felt very bad. Despite the pressure of the detainees, they delayed their attention. Gladis, the daughter of Luisa, 18, who had been tortured to the point of smashing her heels, was also detained there. \"The warders come, they call her daughter and they say to her: 'Your mom died and the baby is dead too, do not even think about crying.' That was Tita's death.\" In another eloquent passage of his statement, he described how repression operated on the workers. For example, a whole section of Fader workers was brought in, they were beaten terribly. Some went to Coronda and others ran, but chastened. There were combined actions with Somisa entrepreneurs. He recalled how companies changed the credentials of their workers, updated the photos, and it was those same credentials that led the task forces to kidnap them. The witness also saw the detainees Perez Risso and Piccolo, very hurt. \"Pérez Risso had a broken arm, and Piccolo had a hole in his head,\" he said. ==Activity in the legal field== Olga Cabrera Hansen is one of the people who worked most, from the legal field, for the reconstruction of what happened in the Information Service of the Rosario police during the dictatorship, the place where the clandestine detention center was set up largest in the province of Santa Fe and where she was detained. When she was released, in 1978, she was not paralyzed. She approached the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights and began to tie things together, relate relatives of the disappeared with former detainees, to reconstruct the courses in what she called yesterday \"that sinister puzzle\". Together with her colleague, Delia Rodríguez Araya, they investigated complaints and gave form to the Feced case, which began in January 1984 in the provincial courts. Until 1979, when she started working at APDH, the agencies limited themselves to receiving requests from relatives and processing habeas corpus that always had negative results. One day, the witness was with Delia, and three young women arrived asking about their sister, María Sol Pérez Losada. \"Did she suffer from the kidneys?\" Olga asked. It was like that, then, she told them to go to Buenos Aires to talk to two detainees who had been with her. \"With that anecdotal fact the entire chain of denunciations began,\" the lawyer recalled yesterday. ==Documentary film== Rosario de Galtieri.

Thanking her, after remembering her husband, a comrade in struggle who was also imprisoned and had to carry out an internal exile, and to remember the suffering her children went through, she assured that the struggle for human rights and justice is still \"not finished.\" ==Who else?== Voices that break the silence is a sculptural, graphic and audio installation that achieves the unthinkable. The piece can be seen and, fundamentally, heard, as of March 2016 in the courtyard of the Museum of Memory, in Córdoba, Argentina corner Moreno, a place of Memory where the Second Army Corps operated in the last dictatorship.12 The lawyer Olga Cabrera Hansen, the psychologist Marta Bertolino, the worker Teresita Marciani, Susy Solanas and Estela Hernández gave their testimonies in 1984 in the trials of the military juntas. All of them were detained by the military dictatorship. Theirs are only five voices among many others, but they have the double peculiarity of expressing the harsh reality of the forced disappearance of people while it was suffered by women, while arming a referential web where the same names of victims are crossed and victimizers, beginning the clarification of the destinies of the disappeared and the responsibilities of their murderers and torturers. > The crimes they narrate happened a few meters from where we heard them, > almost flush with the tiles, sitting or lying on the floor, with the city > and the trees around.

We are completely peaceful and we want only the reconciliation of Cuban society.\" In 2006, Espinosa stated his opposition to U.S. funding for the Cuban dissident movement, calling it \"counterproductive\" and stating that the Cuban people must solve its own problems. Following Raúl Castro's assumption of the presidency, Espinosa expressed his hope that Castro could be the Deng Xiaoping of Cuba, improving the economy and the standard of living. ==Death== He died of liver disease on September 23, 2013, in Spain. ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Cuba Category:Cuban democracy activists Category:Cuban dissidents Category:Cuban economists Category:Cuban journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:University of Havana alumni Category:Deaths from liver disease Category:Cuban prisoners and detainees\n",

      "Solar eclipse of January 23, 1860[SEP]An annular solar eclipse occurred on January 23, 1860 during summer. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. ==Description== The eclipse was visible in much of the South Island and the southernmost portion of North Island around Wellington in New Zealand, it was also visible in all of Antarctica (much of the areas had a 24-hour daylight), South America's Patagonia and Oceanian islands such as Macquarrie, Chatham, Antipodes, Tahiti and Tuamotu It was part of solar saros 119. On the other side as the Moon from the Earth headed towards the left at New Zealand, as the umbral path was outside the South Pole and over the Prime Meridian to the Peninsula, the Moon from the Earth was seen as it was going on bottom, then on the right and on top in the peninsular portion though the Earth rotates to the east as it was north of the South Pole at the Prime Meridian, the rest of the world saw the Moon from the Earth headed towards the left. The umbral portion was 719 km (449 mi) long and started in Northern Antarctica from east of the Prime Meridian to the 40th meridian east all the way to the west of its peninsula and was shown up to 91% obscuration of the sun. The greatest occurred within the Pacific in Peninsular Antarctica at 71.8 N & 117.2 W at 0:27 UTC (4:27 PM local time on January 22) and lasted for over 6 minutes. The eclipse showed up to 50% obscuration off the coast of Antarctica in the area separating the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. ==Related eclipses== === Saros 119 === It is a part of Saros cycle 119, repeating every 18 years, 11 days, containing 71 events. The series started with partial solar eclipse on May 15, 850 AD. It contains total eclipses on August 9, 994 AD and August 20, 1012 with a hybrid eclipse on August 31, 1030. It has annular eclipses from September 10, 1048 through March 18, 1950. The series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on June 24, 2112. The longest duration of totality was only 32 seconds on August 20, 1012. The longest duration of annularity was 7 minutes, 37 seconds on September 1, 1625.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was largely visible over the south Atlantic Ocean and north shores of Antarctica, most prominently the Antarctic Peninsula. The eclipse could also be seen in southern Africa at sunset. Considering the magnitude and the solar altitude, South Africa was the best place to observe this eclipse. In Cape Town, the sun was about 40% obscured, while in Pretoria the sun was 29% obscured.

An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide.

It was the third central solar eclipse visible from Bangkok from 1948 to 1958, where it is rare for a large city to witness four central solar eclipses in just 9.945 years. This was the 20th member Solar Saros 141, and the last of first set of solar eclipses without a penumbral internal contact (without a penumbra northern limit), the next event is the 1973 Dec 24 event, which is the first of 19 solar eclipses with a penumbral internal contact (has penumbral northern and southern limits) until 2298 Jul 09. Occurring only one day before apogee (December 15, 1955), the Moon's apparent diameter was smaller. The duration of annularity at maximum eclipse (closest to but slightly shorter than the longest duration) was 12 minutes, 9.17 seconds in the Indian Ocean. It was the longest annular solar eclipse from December 17, 168 to January 14, 3080.

Totality was visible from northwestern Northland Region in New Zealand on May 31 (Monday), and Manuae in Cook Islands, Manuae and Motu One in French Polynesia, and Peru on May 30 (Sunday). == Related eclipses == === Solar eclipses of 1964–1967=== === Saros 127=== ===Inex series=== Inex series members between 1901 and 2100: Inex series members between 1901 and 2100: Inex series members between 1901 and 2100: 150px July 10, 1907 (Saros 125) 150px June 19, 1936 (Saros 126) 150px May 30, 1965 (Saros 127) 150px May 10, 1994 (Saros 128) 150px April 20, 2023 (Saros 129) 150px March 30, 2052 (Saros 130) 150px March 10, 2081 (Saros 131) ===Metonic series=== ==References== ==External links== *Russia expedition for solar eclipse of May 30, 1965 1965 05 30 Category:1965 in science 1965 05 30 Category:May 1965 events\n",
