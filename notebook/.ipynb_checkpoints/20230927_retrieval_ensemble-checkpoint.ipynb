According to the traditional point of view renormalization is implemented via the introduction of counterterms that should cancel divergent expressions appearing in loop integrals Applying this method to gravity, however, the counterterms required to eliminate all divergences proliferate to an infinite number.

The lens' circular aperture is analogous to a two-dimensional version of the single-slit experiment Light passing through the lens interferes with itself creating a ring-shape diffraction pattern, known as the Airy pattern, if the wavefront of the transmitted light is taken to be spherical or plane over the exit aperture.

Complementary to R is the transmission coefficient, or transmittance, T If absorption and scattering are neglected, then the value T is always 1 − R.

The light ray now reflects twice: once from the surface between air and the thin layer, and once from the layer-to-glass interface. From the equation above and the known refractive indices, reflectivities for both interfaces can be calculated, denoted R01 and R1S respectively.

Those are the numbers of the corresponding angle units in one complete turn. Those definitions of the metre and the nautical mile have been superseded by more precise ones, but the original definitions are still accurate enough for conceptual purposes and some calculations. For example, they imply that one kilometre is exactly 054 nautical miles. Using official modern definitions, one nautical mile is exactly 1.852 kilometres, which implies that 1 kilometre is about 0.53995680 nautical miles.

William J. M.

Even neutrons with energies ranging in the hundreds of MeV will quickly lose energy through collisions in water. Once these neutrons have been thermalized, they undergo radiative capture wherein they are incorporated into a nucleus to produce a more tightly bound state The excess energy is given off as a gamma cascade.

These black holes will converge near the centre of the newly formed galaxy over a period that may take millions of years, due to a process known as dynamical friction: as the SMBHs move relative to the surrounding cloud of much less massive stars, gravitational interactions lead to a net transfer of orbital energy from the SMBHs to the stars, causing the stars to be \"slingshotted\" into higher-radius orbits, and the SMBHs to \"sink\" toward the galactic core When the SMBHs come within one light-year of one another, they will begin to strongly emit gravitational waves that will radiate further orbital energy until they merge completely.\n",

      " The azimuthal quantum number is the second of a set of quantum numbers that describe the unique quantum state of an electron (the others being the principal quantum number n, the magnetic quantum number mℓ, and the spin quantum number ms). It is also known as the orbital angular momentum quantum number, orbital quantum number, subsidiary quantum number, or second quantum number, and is symbolized as ℓ (pronounced ell). Connected with the energy states of the atom's electrons are four quantum numbers: n, ℓ, mℓ, and ms. These specify the complete, unique quantum state of a single electron in an atom, and make up its wavefunction or orbital When solving to obtain the wave function, the Schrödinger equation reduces to three equations that lead to the first three quantum numbers.\n",

Being very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the filar micrometer.

Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so the black hole must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.\n",

However, in 1974, Hawking published a new theory which argued that black holes can \"leak\" radiation. He imagined what might happen if a pair of virtual particles appeared near the edge of a black hole. Virtual particles briefly 'borrow' energy from spacetime itself, then annihilate with each other, returning the borrowed energy and ceasing to exist However, at the edge of a black hole, one virtual particle might be trapped by the black hole while the other escapes. Because of the second law of thermodynamics, particles are 'forbidden' from taking energy from the vacuum. Thus, the particle takes energy from the black hole instead of from the vacuum, and escape from the black hole as Hawking radiation.\n",

This replaced the previous definition, valid between 1960 and 1983, which was that the metre equalled a certain number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. (The reason for the change was an improved method of measuring the speed of light) The speed of light could then be expressed exactly as c0 = 299792458 m/s, a standard also adopted by the IERS numerical standards. From this definition and the 2009 IAU standard, the time for light to traverse an astronomical unit is found to be τA = 499.0047838061±0.00000001 s, which is slightly more than 8 minutes 19 seconds.\n",

Because all photons move at the speed of light in vacuum, a fundamental constant of the universe, the distance of an object from the probe is calculated as the product of the speed of light and the measured time. However, for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting. In addition, the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation Comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) leads to a value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day (of 86400 s).\n",

If, at an entry (or exit) having a cross-sectional area A {\\displaystyle A} m2, a fluid parcel travels a distance d L {\\displaystyle dL} in time d t {\\displaystyle dt} , then the volume flow rate ( V {\\displaystyle V} m3 ⋅ {\\displaystyle \\cdot } s−1) is given by: V = A ⋅ d L Δ t {\\displaystyle V=A\\cdot {\\frac {dL}{\\Delta t}}} but since d L Δ t {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dL}{\\Delta t}}} is the fluid velocity ( v {\\displaystyle v} m ⋅ {\\displaystyle \\cdot } s−1) we can write: Q = V × A {\\displaystyle Q=V\\times A} The mass flow rate ( m {\\displaystyle m} kg ⋅ {\\displaystyle \\cdot } s−1) is given by the product of density and volume flow rate m = ρ ⋅ Q = ρ ⋅ V ⋅ A {\\displaystyle m=\\rho \\cdot Q=\\rho \\cdot V\\cdot A} [inconsistent] Because of conservation of mass, between two points in a flowing fluid we can write m 1 = m 2 {\\displaystyle m_{1}=m_{2}}  This is equivalent to: ρ 1 V 1 A 1 = ρ 2 V 2 A 2 {\\displaystyle \\rho _{1}V_{1}A_{1}=\\rho _{2}V_{2}A_{2}} If the fluid is incompressible, ( ρ 1 = ρ 2 {\\displaystyle \\rho _{1}=\\rho _{2}} ) then: V 1 A 1 = V 2 A 2 {\\displaystyle V_{1}A_{1}=V_{2}A_{2}} This result can be applied to many areas in astrophysical fluid dynamics, such as neutron stars.\n",

      " Conservation of momentum The mathematical formulation of this principle can be considered an application of Newton's Second Law. Momentum within a flow is only changed by external forces, which may include both surface forces, such as viscous (frictional) forces, and body forces, such as weight. The momentum conservation principle may be expressed as either a vector equation or separated into a set of three scalar equations (x,y,z components). Conservation of energy The energy conservation equation states that energy is neither created nor destroyed within a flow, and that any addition or subtraction of energy to a volume in the flow is caused by heat transfer, or by work into and out of the region of interest Together, these equations are known as the Navier–Stokes equations, although some authors define the term to only include the momentum equation(s).\n",

Speakers use passive analog crossovers, and analog equalizers use capacitors to select different audio bands. Most capacitors are designed to maintain a fixed physical structure. However, various factors can change the structure of the capacitor; the resulting change in capacitance can be used to sense those factors.\n",

      "#Applications of capacitors\n",
      " Reservoir capacitors are used in power supplies where they smooth the output of a full or half wave rectifier. They can also be used in charge pump circuits as the energy storage element in the generation of higher voltages than the input voltage. Capacitors are connected in parallel with the DC power circuits of most electronic devices to smooth current fluctuations for signal or control circuits. Audio equipment, for example, uses several capacitors in this way, to shunt away power line hum before it gets into the signal circuitry The capacitors act as a local reserve for the DC power source, and bypass AC currents from the power supply. This is used in car audio applications, when a stiffening capacitor compensates for the inductance and resistance of the leads to the lead-acid car battery.\n",

      " This is analogous to the angular momentum of an object that is spinning around its center of mass, although strictly speaking these particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating. Spin is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant (ħ), with electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin 1⁄2 ħ, or \"spin-1⁄2\". In an atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular momentum in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses angular momentum due to its nuclear spin. The magnetic field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a magnetic field, but the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin Due to the nature of electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state.\n",

As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield (about 51 photons/keV), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and is relatively easy to purify. Compared to xenon, argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile, which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils On the other hand, its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to 39 Ar contamination, unless one uses argon from underground sources, which has much less 39 Ar contamination.

The ionization and scintillation signals can be measured with dedicated readout techniques, which constituted a fundamental part of the detector. In order to get a high enough target mass the noble gas argon was used in the liquid phase as target material.

Where weight is not an issue, a heavier chain provides better holding by forming a catenary curve through the water and resting as much of its length on the bottom as would not be lifted by tension of the mooring load. Any changes to the tension are accommodated by additional chain being lifted or settling on the bottom, and this absorbs shock loads until the chain is straight, at which point the full load is taken by the anchor. Additional dissipation of shock loads can be achieved by fitting a snubber between the chain and a bollard or cleat on deck This also reduces shock loads on the deck fittings, and the vessel usually lies more comfortably and quietly.\n",

However, for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting. In addition, the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation.

In the second postulate, Einstein proposes that the speed of light has the same value in all frames of reference, independent of the state of motion of the emitting body Special relativity is thus consistent with the result of the Michelson–Morley experiment, which had not detected a medium of conductance (or aether) for light waves unlike other known waves that require a medium (such as water or air), and which had been crucial for the development of the Lorentz transformations and the principle of relativity.\n",

The most commonly described case, sometimes called the Aharonov–Bohm solenoid effect, takes place when the wave function of a charged particle passing around a long solenoid experiences a phase shift as a result of the enclosed magnetic field, despite the magnetic field being negligible in the region through which the particle passes and the particle's wavefunction being negligible inside the solenoid. This phase shift has been observed experimentally. There are also magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effects on bound energies and scattering cross sections, but these cases have not been experimentally tested An electric Aharonov–Bohm phenomenon was also predicted, in which a charged particle is affected by regions with different electrical potentials but zero electric field, but this has no experimental confirmation yet.\n",

For example, the SWR bandwidth is typically determined by measuring the frequency range where the SWR is less than 2:1  Another frequently used value for determining bandwidth for resonant antennas is the −3 dB return loss value, since loss due to SWR is   −10·log10(2÷1) = −3.\n",

Attenuation can be caused by the physical process of \"absorption\", but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes Absorbance of a material is approximately equal to its attenuance[clarification needed] when both the absorbance is much less than 1 and the emittance of that material (not to be confused with radiant exitance or emissivity) is much less than the absorbance. Indeed, Φ e t + Φ e att = Φ e i + Φ e e , {\\displaystyle \\Phi _{\\text{e}}^{\\text{t}}+\\Phi _{\\text{e}}^{\\text{att}}=\\Phi _{\\text{e}}^{\\text{i}}+\\Phi _{\\text{e}}^{\\text{e}},} where Φet is the radiant power transmitted by that material, Φeatt is the radiant power attenuated by that material, Φei is the radiant power received by that material, Φee is the radiant power emitted by that material, that is equivalent to T + ATT = 1 + E , {\\displaystyle T+{\\text{ATT}}=1+E,} where T = Φet/Φei is the transmittance of that material, ATT = Φeatt/Φei is the attenuance of that material, E = Φee/Φei is the emittance of that material, and according to Beer–Lambert law, T = 10−A, so ATT = 1 − 10 − A + E ≈ A ln ⁡ 10 + E , if   A ≪ 1 , {\\displaystyle {\\text{ATT}}=1-10^{-A}+E\\approx A\\ln 10+E,\\quad {\\text{if}}\\ A\\ll 1,} and finally ATT ≈ A ln ⁡ 10 , if   E ≪ A .\n",

      " The origin of the notion \"virtual mass\" becomes evident when we take a look at the momentum equation for the particle. m p d v d t = ∑ F + ρ c V p 2 ( D u D t − d v d t ) , {\\displaystyle m_{\\mathrm {p} }{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {v} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\sum \\mathbf {F} +{\\frac {\\rho _{\\mathrm {c} }V_{\\mathrm {p} }}{2}}\\left({\\frac {\\mathrm {D} \\mathbf {u} }{\\mathrm {D} t}}-{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {v} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}\\right),} where ∑ F {\\displaystyle \\sum \\mathbf {F} } is the sum of all other force terms on the particle, such as gravity, pressure gradient, drag, lift, Basset force, etc. Moving the derivative of the particle velocity from the right hand side of the equation to the left we get ( m p + ρ c V p 2 ) d v d t = ∑ F + ρ c V p 2 D u D t , {\\displaystyle \\left(m_{\\mathrm {p} }+{\\frac {\\rho _{\\mathrm {c} }V_{\\mathrm {p} }}{2}}\\right){\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {v} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}=\\sum \\mathbf {F} +{\\frac {\\rho _{\\mathrm {c} }V_{\\mathrm {p} }}{2}}{\\frac {\\mathrm {D} \\mathbf {u} }{\\mathrm {D} t}},} so the particle is accelerated as if it had an added mass of half the fluid it displaces, and there is also an additional force contribution on the right hand side due to acceleration of the fluid. The added mass can be incorporated into most physics equations by considering an effective mass as the sum of the mass and added mass This sum is commonly known as the \"virtual mass\".\n",

He proved in passing that these were not isolated feats, but part of a general scientific renaissance, which \"transcends the reductionist paradigm with progress in the ability to grasp the complex\". It also allowed him to confirm the inadequacy of determinism, one of the oldest intuitions: by virtue of which all kinds of physical systems exhibit relationships of uncertainty because they are invented at every instant, unlike idealized entities, where sooner or later some abstraction is projected as the law of the event. That neither the Nobel Prize in Chemistry received by Prigogine, nor the Fields Medal —its equivalent in mathematics— not awarded to Mandelbrot, have prevented their absence from Spanish curricula —where they continue to be systematically ignored not only by high school students, but also by those taking doctorates in the exact sciences, Engineering, Physics or Chemistry—, led Escohotado to affirm: dogmatism takes root in the sectors of science most dependent on a progressive subsidy, where any testimony of non-linear processes contradicts those who claim to be on the verge of having the cosmic formula for everything, compressed into half a line of signs Chaos and Order criticizes this \"guild infallibilism\" from different perspectives, arguing that we are beginning to glimpse reality, after centuries of trying to adapt it to the ideal of some theological or atheistic faith, precisely thanks to the understanding of phenomena of self-organization.\n",

      " While angular momentum total conservation can be understood separately from Newton's laws of motion as stemming from Noether's theorem in systems symmetric under rotations, it can also be understood simply as an efficient method of calculation of results that can also be otherwise arrived at directly from Newton's second law, together with laws governing the forces of nature (such as Newton's third law, Maxwell's equations and Lorentz force). Indeed, given initial conditions of position and velocity for every point, and the forces at such a condition, one may use Newton's second law to calculate the second derivative of position, and solving for this gives full information on the development of the physical system with time. Note, however, that this is no longer true in quantum mechanics, due to the existence of particle spin, which is angular momentum that cannot be described by the cumulative effect of point-like motions in space.

Lorentz' theory matched experiment well, but it was complicated and made many unsubstantiated physical assumptions about the microscopic nature of electromagnetic media In his 1905 theory of special relativity, Albert Einstein reinterpreted the results of Lorentz' theory in a much simpler and more natural conceptual framework which disposed of the idea of an aether. His derivation is given above, and is now the accepted explanation. Robert S.

      " In essence, following any particle scattering or interaction between two larger systems, the relative phases of the two systems are at first orderly related, but subsequent interactions (with additional particles or systems) make them less so, so that the two systems become decoherent. Thus decoherence is a form of increase in microscopic disorder – in short, decoherence increases entropy. Two decoherent systems can no longer interact via quantum superposition, unless they become coherent again, which is normally impossible, by the second law of thermodynamics. In the language of relational quantum mechanics, the observer becomes entangled with the measured state, where this entanglement increases entropy As stated by Seth Lloyd, \"the arrow of time is an arrow of increasing correlations\". However, under special circumstances, one can prepare initial conditions that will cause a decrease in decoherence and in entropy.\n",

A sequence of distributions corresponds to a sequence of random variables Zi for i = 1, 2, ..., I . In the simplest case, an asymptotic distribution exists if the probability distribution of Zi converges to a probability distribution (the asymptotic distribution) as i increases: see convergence in distribution.

      " An electron density distribution of a molecule is a probability distribution that describes the average manner in which the electronic charge is distributed throughout real space in the attractive field exerted by the nuclei. According to QTAIM, molecular structure is revealed by the stationary points of the electron density together with the gradient paths of the electron density that originate and terminate at these points. QTAIM was primarily developed by Professor Richard Bader and his research group at McMaster University over the course of decades, beginning with analyses of theoretically calculated electron densities of simple molecules in the early 1960s and culminating with analyses of both theoretically and experimentally measured electron densities of crystals in the 90s. The development of QTAIM was driven by the assumption that, since the concepts of atoms and bonds have been and continue to be so ubiquitously useful in interpreting, classifying, predicting and communicating chemistry, they should have a well-defined physical basis QTAIM recovers the central operational concepts of the molecular structure hypothesis, that of a functional grouping of atoms with an additive and characteristic set of properties, together with a definition of the bonds that link the atoms and impart the structure.\n",

      " In aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow. Aerodynamics is a significant element of vehicle design, including road cars and trucks where the main goal is to reduce the vehicle drag coefficient, and racing cars, where in addition to reducing drag the goal is also to increase the overall level of downforce Aerodynamics is also important in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers resort to aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, when calculating wind loads in the design of large buildings, bridges, and wind turbines.\n",

Over the years, many additional theories have been put forward attempting to explain the effect. The ground state destabilization theory proposes that the electron-electron repulsion between the alpha lone-pair and nucleophilic electron pair destabilize each other by electronic repulsion (filled–filled orbital interaction) thereby decreasing the activation barrier by increasing the ground state energy and making it more reactive. This explains the higher reactivity of α-nucleophiles, however, this electronic mechanism should also increase the basicity and, therefore, cannot fully explain the α-effect Many explanations fall into this category.\n",

Antiaromaticity can also have a significant effect on pKa. The linear compound propene has a pKa of 44, which is relatively acidic for an sp3 carbon center because the resultant allyl anion can be resonance stabilized The analogous cyclic system appears to have even more resonance stabilized, as the negative charge can be delocalized across three carbons instead of two. However, the cyclopropenyl anion has 4 π electrons in a cyclic system and in fact has a substantially higher pKa than 1-propene because it is antiaromatic and thus destabilized.\n",

      " In historical geology, the primary methods of absolute dating involve using the radioactive decay of elements trapped in rocks or minerals, including isotope systems from younger organic remains (radiocarbon dating with 14 C) to systems such as uranium–lead dating that allow determination of absolute ages for some of the oldest rocks on Earth. Radiometric dating is based on the known and constant rate of decay of radioactive isotopes into their radiogenic daughter isotopes. Particular isotopes are suitable for different applications due to the types of atoms present in the mineral or other material and its approximate age. For example, techniques based on isotopes with half-lives in the thousands of years, such as carbon-14, cannot be used to date materials that have ages on the order of billions of years, as the detectable amounts of the radioactive atoms and their decayed daughter isotopes will be too small to measure within the uncertainty of the instruments One of the most widely used and well-known absolute dating techniques is carbon-14 (or radiocarbon) dating, which is used to date organic remains.\n",

Powerful fans could push air through reactors of zeolite and catalysts to absorb the methane The reactor could then be heated to form and release CO 2. Because of methane's higher GWP, at a carbon price of $500/ton removing one ton of methane would earn $12,000. In 2021, Methane Action proposed adding iron to seawater sprays from ship smokestacks.

One way of depicting ascendency is to regard it as \"organized power\", because the index represents the magnitude of the power that is flowing within the system towards particular ends, as distinct from power that is dissipated naturally. Almost half a century earlier, Alfred J. Lotka (1922) had suggested that a system's capacity to prevail in evolution was related to its ability to capture useful power.\n",

The electrical and thermal conductivity of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, Young's modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element, but engineering properties such as tensile strength, ductility, and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present.\n",

      " In this theory, there are two main effects that govern the change of resistivity with increasing temperatures. Both are based on the induction of vibrations of the atomic nuclei of the metal as temperatures increase. One is, that the atomic structure gets increasingly smeared out as the exact positions of the atomic nuclei get less and less well defined. The other is the introduction of phonons While the smearing out generally decreases the resistivity of the metal, the introduction of phonons generally adds scattering sites and therefore increases resistivity. Together, they can explain the anomalous decrease of resistivity in amorphous metals, as the first part outweighs the second. In contrast to regular crystalline metals, the phonon contribution in an amorphous metal does not get frozen out at low temperatures.\n",

      " These equations combine the spacetime geometry encoded in the metric g μ ν {\\displaystyle g_{\\mu \\nu }} with the matter content comprised in the energy–momentum tensor T μ ν {\\displaystyle T_{\\mu \\nu }} . The quantum nature of matter has been tested experimentally, for instance quantum electrodynamics is by now one of the most accurately confirmed theories in physics. For this reason quantization of gravity seems plausible, too. Unfortunately the quantization cannot be performed in the standard way (perturbative renormalization): Already a simple power-counting consideration signals the perturbative nonrenormalizability since the mass dimension of Newton's constant is − 2 {\\displaystyle -2}  The problem occurs as follows. According to the traditional point of view renormalization is implemented via the introduction of counterterms that should cancel divergent expressions appearing in loop integrals.\n",

In three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined in terms of an orientation, which is typically determined by a normal vector passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie In navigation, bearings or azimuth are measured relative to north.\n",

Only two numbers, not three, are needed to define the direction of a unit vector e rooted at the origin because the magnitude of e is constrained. For example, the elevation and azimuth angles of e suffice to locate it in any particular Cartesian coordinate frame.

They are studied as part of the fields of combinatorics and representation theory. A finite symmetric group consists of all permutations of a finite set. Each affine symmetric group is an infinite extension of a finite symmetric group Many important combinatorial properties of the finite symmetric groups can be extended to the corresponding affine symmetric groups. Permutation statistics such as descents and inversions can be defined in the affine case. As in the finite case, the natural combinatorial definitions for these statistics also have a geometric interpretation.

These gravitational waves can work as sort of standard sirens to measure the expansion rate of the universe. Abbot et al. 2017 measured the Hubble constant value to be approximately 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec The amplitudes of the strain 'h' is dependent on the masses of the objects causing waves, distances from observation point and gravitational waves detection frequencies. The associated distance measures are dependent on the cosmological parameters like the Hubble Constant for nearby objects and will be dependent on other cosmological parameters like the dark energy density, matter density, etc. for distant sources.\n",

      "The ant–fungus mutualism is a symbiosis seen between certain ant and fungal species, in which ants actively cultivate fungus much like humans farm crops as a food source. There is only evidence of two instances in which this form of agriculture evolved in ants resulting in a dependence on fungi for food. These instances were the attine ants and some ants that are part of the Megalomyrmex genus. In some species, the ants and fungi are dependent on each other for survival. This type of codependency is prevalent among herbivores who rely on plant material for nutrition. The fungus’ ability to convert the plant material into a food source accessible to their host makes them the ideal partner. The leafcutter ant is a well-known example of this symbiosis.\n",

      " A further specialization occurred from the opportunity that this coevolution offered. Up until this point the ant host had been feeding their cultivars primarily with detritus and fecal matter. The shift towards herbivory consisted of certain groups of attine ants (the ancestors of Atta and Acromyrmex) shifting towards fresh plant matter as a substrate for growing their gardens. This shift provided the opportunity for the development of industrial-scale agriculture that we now see in the Atta and Acromyrmex genera There is debate in the field on the \"tightness\" of the coevolution between ants and their fungal cultivars. While the observed vertical transmission of fungal cultivars and strong host-symbiont specificity might suggest a tight coevolutionary relationship, recent phylogenetic analyses suggest this is not the case.\n",

      " There are two types of natural ventilation occurring in buildings: wind driven ventilation and buoyancy-driven ventilation. Wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure, and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building. Buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior. Since the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes, including the heat from people, and wind effects are variable, naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called \"breathing buildings\" Passive cooling is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor thermal comfort with low or no energy consumption.\n",

The adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas. Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature. In contrast, free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas Adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased by work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a piston compressing a gas contained within a cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time. This finds practical application in diesel engines which rely on the lack of heat dissipation during the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.\n",

The rotor reduces the relative kinetic head of the fluid and adds it to the absolute kinetic head of the fluid ie., the impact of the rotor on the fluid particles increases their velocity (absolute) and thereby reduces the relative velocity between the fluid and the rotor. In short, the rotor increases the absolute velocity of the fluid and the stator converts this into pressure rise.

Throughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was particularly well known for his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the Mathematical Theory of Relativity in 1923, which Albert Einstein suggested was \"the finest presentation of the subject in any language\" He was an early advocate of Einstein's general relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: Ludwik Silberstein, a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the Royal Society's (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's relativity with his Brazil-Príncipe solar eclipse calculations with some degree of scepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other).\n"

      "\n",
      "original_text:\n",
      "  When the barrier to racemization is high, as illustrated by the BINAP ligands, the phenomenon becomes of practical value in asymmetric synthesis. Methaqualone, the anxiolytic and hypnotic-sedative, is a classical example of a drug molecule that exhibits the phenomenon of atropisomerism. Determining the axial stereochemistry of biaryl atropisomers can be accomplished through the use of a Newman projection along the axis of hindered rotation. The ortho, and in some cases meta substituents are first assigned priority based on Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules. One scheme of nomenclature in based on envisioning the helicity defined by these groups. Starting with the substituent of highest priority in the closest ring and moving along the shortest path to the substituent of highest priority in the other ring, the absolute configuration is assigned P or Δ for clockwise and M or Λ for counterclockwise. Alternately, all four groups can be ranked by Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules, with overall priority given to the groups on the \"front\" atom of the Newman projection. The two configurations are termed Ra and Sa in analogy to the traditional R/S for a traditional tetrahedral stereocenter. Axially chiral biaryl compounds are prepared by coupling reactions, e.g., Ullmann coupling, Suzuki–Miyaura reaction, or palladium-catalyzed arylation of arenes. Subsequent to the synthesis, the racemic biaryl is resolved by classical methods. Diastereoselective coupling can be achieved through the use of a chiral bridge that links the two aryl groups or through the use of a chiral auxiliary at one of the positions proximal to axial bridge. Enantioselective coupling can be achieved through the use of a chiral leaving group on one of the biaryls or under oxidative conditions that utilize chiral amines to set the axial configuration. Individual atropisomers can be isolated by seed-directed crystallization of racemates. Thus, 1,1'-Binaphthyl crystallizes from the melt as individual enantiomers. In one application the asymmetry in an atropisomer is transferred in a chemical reaction to a new stereocenter. The atropisomer is an iodoaryl compound synthesised starting from (S)-valine and exists as the (M,S) isomer and the (P,S) isomer. The interconversion barrier between the two is 24.3 kcal/mol (101.7 kJ/mol). The (M,S) isomer can be obtained exclusively from this mixture by recrystallisation from hexanes. The iodine group is homolytically removed to form an aryl radical by a tributyltin hydride/triethylboron/oxygen mixture as in the Barton–McCombie reaction. Although the hindered rotation is now removed in the aryl radical, the intramolecular reaction with the alkene is so much faster than is rotation of the carbon–nitrogen bond that the stereochemistry is preserved. In this way the (M,S) isomer yields the (S,S) dihydroindolone. The most important class of atropisomers are biaryls such as diphenic acid, which is a derivative of biphenyl with a complete set of ortho substituents. Heteroaromatic analogues of the biphenyl compounds also exist, where hindered rotation occurs about a carbon-nitrogen or a nitrogen-nitrogen bond. Others are dimers of naphthalene derivatives such as 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol. In a similar way, aliphatic ring systems like cyclohexanes linked through a single bond may display atropisomerism provided that bulky substituents are present. The use of axially chiral biaryl compounds such as BINAP, QUINAP and BINOL, have been found to be useful in the area of asymmetric catalysis as chiral ligands. Their ability to provide stereoinduction has led to use in metal catalyzed hydrogenation, epoxidation, addition, and allylic alkylation reactions. Other reactions that can be catalyzed by the use of chiral biaryl compounds are the Grignard reaction, Ullmann reaction, and the Suzuki reaction. A recent example in the area of chiral biaryl asymmetric catalysis employs a five-membered imidazole as part of the atropisomer scaffold. This specific phosphorus, nitrogen-ligand has been shown to perform enantioselective A3-coupling. Atropisomeric Natural Products Mastigophorene A Knipholone (–)-N-Acetylallocolchinol Many atropisomers occur in nature, and some have applications to drug design. The natural product mastigophorene A has been found to aid in nerve growth. Other examples of naturally occurring atropisomers include vancomycin isolated from an Actinobacterium, and knipholone, which is found in the roots of Kniphofia foliosa of the family Asphodelaceae. The structure complexity in vancomycin is significant because it can bind with peptides due to the complexity of its stereochemistry, which includes multiple stereocenters, two chiral planes in its stereogenic biaryl axis. Knipholone, with its axial chirality, occurs in nature and has been shown to offer good antimalarial and antitumor activities particularly in the M form. The use of atropisomeric drugs provides an additional way for drugs to have stereochemical variations and specificity in design\n",

      "  In the same year, Monks showed experimentally that the \"comets\" developing from the severed arms of Linckia columbiae could indeed grow into new individuals. Linckia multifora and Linckia guildingi are two species of starfish found on Hawaii which were found to exhibit autotomy, shedding one or more arms frequently. The arms are known as \"comets\" and can move about independently and each one can grow into a new individual. Though severed from the nervous system and the water vascular system they still exhibit normal behaviour patterns. In a study undertaken in Hawaii, it was found that the detachment of an arm was not a sudden event. Most fractures took place about 2.5 cm (1 in) from the disk and started with a small crack appearing on the lower surface of the arm. This spread laterally and upwards towards the dorsal surface. Then the tube feet on the arm and those on the body pulled the two parts of the animal in opposite directions until they parted. The process could take about an hour to complete. The damaged tissue healed in about 10 days and the animal grew a new arm over the course of several months. Breaks took place in various positions on the arm, though Crozier noted a particular breaking zone in Coscinasterias tenuispina. The immediate cause of the autotomy is not always apparent. Of 50 specimens of Linckia multifora brought to the laboratory, 18 had shed one or more arms within 24 hours. The mortality rate of newly severed arms was high, many succumbing to bacterial infection while the wounds were fresh. Once the wound had healed, in about 10 days, survival was more likely. When arms were severed into several lengths in the laboratory, it was found that those over 1 cm (0.4 in) in length were capable of regenerating. These included the tips of the arms and the central sections with wounds at each end. It takes about 10 months to regenerate a new disk with arms 1 cm (0.4 in) in length. The first development in the regeneration cycle is the formation of a crescent-shaped ridge at the damaged end. Grooves begin to form and a mouth develops at the point from which they radiate. The arms start to form and tube feet begin to appear. As the arms grow the disc begins to develop and eventually a madreporite appears. This process lasts for some time, and about 10 months after separation, the comet has a half disc and 4 arms about 1 cm (0.4 in) long.

      " Abraham Arthur Gottlieb (December 14, 1937 – June 7, 1998) was an American biologist and immunologist. Gottlieb was born in Haifa under the British Mandate on December 14, 1937, to an American mother and a British father, who was then deputy minister of agriculture under the British Mandate. He grew up with his mother who returned to New York when he was 13 months old. Gottlieb attended the Bronx High School of Science with the class of 1954. He entered Columbia College in 1953 under the early admission scholarship program by Ford Foundation. He was a coxswain for Columbia's rowing team and graduated from Columbia in 1957, phi beta kappa. Gottlieb received his medical degree from New York University School of Medicine with the highest class standing and did his medical internship and residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He worked in the National Heart Institute while serving in the United States Public Health Service and became a faculty member at Harvard Medical School in 1968. He became a tenured professor at Rutgers University in 1972 before joining the faculty of Tulane Medical School in 1975 as chairman of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology and professor of Medicine for 23 years until his death in 1998. Gottlieb's research has focused on the linkages between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system. He was also the founder and chief executive of Imreg Inc., a company he founded to search for new substances that bolster the human immune system. He was a fellow of the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Microbiology. In 1987, Gottlieb carried out tests on the body fluid and tissue samples of a deceased St. Louis teenager, showing that AIDS was present in the United States as early as 1969, a decade before the disease was believed to have existed in this country.

Zelevinsky graduated in 1969 from the Moscow Mathematical School No. 2. After winning a silver medal as a member of the USSR team at the International Mathematical Olympiad he was admitted without examination to the mathematics department of Moscow State University where he obtained his PhD in 1978 under the mentorship of Joseph Bernstein, Alexandre Kirillov and Israel Gelfand. He worked in the mathematical laboratory of Vladimir Keilis-Borok at the Institute of Earth Science (1977–85), and at the Council for Cybernetics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (1985–90). In the early 1980s, at a great personal risk, he taught at the Jewish People's University, an unofficial organization offering first-class mathematics education to talented students denied admission to Moscow State University's math department. In 1990–91, Zelevinsky was a visiting professor at Cornell University, and from 1991 until his death was on faculty at Northeastern University, Boston. With his wife, Galina, he had a son and a daughter; he also had several grandchildren. Zelevinsky is a relative of the physicists Vladimir Zelevinsky and Tanya Zelevinsky. Zelevinsky's most notable achievement is the discovery (with Sergey Fomin) of cluster algebras. His other contributions include: Bernstein–Zelevinsky classification of representations of p-adic groups; introduction (jointly with Israel Gelfand and Mikhail Kapranov) of A-systems of hypergeometric equations (also known as GKZ-systems) and development of the theory of hyperdeterminants; generalization of the Littlewood–Richardson rule and Robinson–Schensted correspondence using the combinatorics of \"pictures\"; work (jointly with Arkady Berenstein and Sergey Fomin) on total positivity; work (with Sergey Fomin) on the Laurent phenomenon, including its applications to Somos sequences.

      " Isomers that differ only in the configuration at the anomeric carbon are called anomers. The anomers of D-glucopyranose are diastereomers, with the beta anomer having an OH group pointing up equatorially, and the alpha anomer having that OH group pointing down axially. The anomeric effect can also be generalized to any cyclohexyl or linear system with the general formula C-Y-C-X, where Y is a heteroatom with one or more lone pairs, and X is an electronegative atom or group. The magnitude of the anomeric effect is estimated at about 1–2 kcal/mol in the case of sugars, but is different for every molecule In the above case, the methoxy group on the cyclohexane ring (top) prefers the equatorial position. However, in the tetrahydropyran ring (bottom), the methoxy group prefers the axial position.\n",

      " Ask A Biologist is a science outreach program originating from Arizona State University's School of Life Sciences, a unit of the ASU College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Ask A Biologist is a pre-kindergarten through high school program dedicated to answering questions from students, their teachers, and parents. The primary focus of the program is to connect students and teachers with working scientists through a question and answer Web e-mail form. The companion website also includes a large collection of free content and activities that can be used inside, as well as outside, of the classroom. The award-winning program has been continuously running for more than 14 years, with the assistance of more than 150 volunteer scientists, faculty, and graduate students in biology and related fields. In 2010 the program released its new website interface and features that became the subject for articles in the journals Science and PLoS Biology. Ask A Biologist materials are free and open to anyone with access to the World-Wide-Web. The question portion of the program serves primarily students, grades preK-12, as well as their teachers and parents. In addition, lifelong learners are encouraged to use the website materials. Ask A Biologist was launched late in 1997 by Charles Kazilek in the School of Life Sciences, with an early version viewable on the Internet Archive a.k.a. The WayBackMachine. Initially, the site consisted solely of a question submission form, a feature that remains one of its core activities. By 2001, the site had grown to over 1,000 pages of content, including articles about current research, profiles of scientists, an image gallery, mystery images, puzzles, coloring pages, quizzes, and science activities. In 2003, the website released the Virtual Pocket Seed Experiment, the first of several data sets that could be used in and outside of the classroom. The experiment was based on the classic seed germination experiment, but included the feature of time-lapse animation of various seed experiments. In 2004, a second data set was released, in cooperation with Audubon Arizona. The Virtual Bird Aviary, included the majority of bird species found in the Southwest United States including more than 400 vocal recordings and companion sonograms, bird images, text descriptions, and range maps. In 2005, the website was peer reviewed by the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT), earning a \"five out of five star\" rating. In 2006, the website introduced the Mysterious World of Dr. Biology a comic book adventure. The activity encouraged students to piece together a mystery. Students reconstructed a chain of events in the Dr. Biology laboratory and field site, writing their own narrative for the story. Early in 2007, Ask A Biologist became one of the early content channels on iTunes U with its audio podcast of the same name. Hosted by Dr. Biology, the program was soon listed as one of five great courses by Macworld. Some of the guest scientists interviewed on the show included biologists and Pulitzer Prize-winning authors Edward O. Wilson and Bert Hölldobler, as well as physicist and writer Paul Davies. In 2008, the audio podcast program introduced a co-host contest that offered students in the Phoenix metro area the opportunity to meet and interview working scientists. In 2009, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the redesign of the Ask A Biologist website including the addition of Web 2.0 tools as part of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL). In 2010, Ask A Biologist released its new website developed using a Web content management tool Drupal and adding Web 2.0 options. The new content management expanded website features including translations of content into French and Spanish and an improved interface for audio streaming. The website was officially accessioned by the NSDL in September. In 2011 two new sections were added to the website.

      " Among the most important points highlighted seem to be the preparation of the teacher, consideration of how to impart preliminary information to help people understand the pathophysiology of diabetes, the optimum selection of topics to be covered, the arrangement of the lessons, how to involve each of the participants, and how to deal with questions. Other important issues include how to spot and deal with some of the difficulties that may be encountered by participants who apparently seem uninterested, obtaining feedback from the lessons, and practical ideas about how to lead a class. Guidelines for health-care professionals planning to teach with AIDA have been published in the diabetes literature. The same authors have also put together some recommended training requirements for health-carers planning to teach using the AIDA interactive educational diabetes simulator The researchers have set out to answer possible questions from teachers using the program, highlight some minimum recommended training requirements for the software, suggest some \"hints and tips\" for teaching ideas, explain the importance of performing more studies / trials with the program, overview randomised controlled trial usage of the software, and highlight the importance of obtaining feedback from lesson participants.\n",

      "  There is something like modesty in the implication that the crack-shell pebble has not yet taken effect; it might have been thought that the slinger would by this time have been singing – And thrice [and one-eighth] I routed all my foes, And thrice [and one-eighth] I slew the slain. In the region of pure mathematics, De Morgan could detect easily the false from the true paradox; but he was not so proficient in the field of physics. His father-in-law was a paradoxer, and his wife a paradoxer; and in the opinion of the physical philosophers De Morgan himself scarcely escaped. His wife wrote a book describing the phenomena of spiritualism, table-rapping, table-turning, etc.; and De Morgan wrote a preface in which he said that he knew some of the asserted facts, believed others on testimony, but did not pretend to know whether they were caused by spirits, or had some unknown and unimagined origin. From this alternative he left out ordinary material causes. Faraday delivered a lecture on Spiritualism, in which he laid it down that in the investigation we ought to set out with the idea of what is physically possible, or impossible; De Morgan did not believe this. De Morgan developed the calculus of relations in his Syllabus of a Proposed System of Logic (1966: 208–46), first published in 1860. De Morgan was able to show that reasoning with syllogisms could be replaced with composition of relations. The calculus was described as the logic of relatives by Charles Sanders Peirce, who admired De Morgan and met him shortly before his death. The calculus was further extended in the third volume of Ernst Schröder's Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik. Binary relations, especially order theory, proved critical to the Principia Mathematica of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead. In turn, this calculus became the subject of much further work, starting in 1940, by Alfred Tarski and his colleagues and students at the University of California. De Morgan later in his life became interested in the phenomena of spiritualism. In 1849, he had investigated clairvoyance and was impressed by the subject. He later carried out paranormal investigations in his own home with the American medium Maria Hayden. The result of those investigations was later published by his wife Sophia. De Morgan believed that his career as a scientist might have been affected if he had revealed his interest in the study of spiritualism, so he helped to publish the book anonymously. The book was published in 1863, titled From Matter to Spirit: The Result of Ten Years Experience in Spirit Manifestations. According to historian Janet Oppenheim, De Morgan's wife Sophia was a convinced spiritualist but De Morgan shared a third way position on spiritualist phenomena, which Oppenheim defined as a \"wait-and-see position\"; he was neither a believer nor a sceptic. Instead, his viewpoint was that the methodology of the physical sciences does not automatically exclude psychic phenomena, and that such phenomena may be explainable in time by the possible existence of natural forces which physicists had not yet identified. In the preface of From Matter to Spirit (1863), De Morgan stated: Thinking it very likely that the universe may contain a few agencies – say half a million – about which no man knows anything, I can not but suspect that a small proportion of these agencies – say five thousand – may be severally competent to the production of all the [spiritualist] phenomena, or may be quite up to the task among them. The physical explanations which I have seen are easy, but miserably insufficient: the spiritualist hypothesis is sufficient, but ponderously difficult. Time and thought will decide, the second asking the first for more results of trial. Psychical researcher John Beloff wrote that De Morgan was the first notable scientist in Britain to take an interest in the study of spiritualism and his studies had influenced the decision of William Crookes to also study spiritualism. Beloff also claims that De Morgan was an atheist and so he was debarred from a position at Oxford or Cambridge. Beyond his great mathematical legacy, the headquarters of the London Mathematical Society is called De Morgan House and the student society of the Mathematics Department of University College London is called the Augustus De Morgan Society.

      "  The cratons are from south to north, the Kalahari Craton, Congo Craton, Tanzania Craton and West African Craton. The cratons were widely separated in the past, but came together during the Pan-African orogeny and stayed together when Gondwana split up. The cratons are connected by orogenic belts, regions of highly deformed rock where the tectonic plates have engaged. The Saharan Metacraton has been tentatively identified as the remains of a craton that has become detached from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, but alternatively may consist of a collection of unrelated crustal fragments swept together during the Pan-African orogeny. In some areas, the cratons are covered by sedimentary basins, such as the Tindouf Basin, Taoudeni Basin and Congo Basin, where the underlying archaic crust is overlaid by more recent Neoproterozoic sediments. The plate includes shear zones such as the Central African Shear Zone (CASZ) where, in the past, two sections of the crust were moving in opposite directions, and rifts such as the Anza Trough where the crust was pulled apart, and the resulting depression filled with more modern sediment. The African Plate is rifting in the eastern interior of the African continent along the East African Rift. This rift zone separates the African Plate to the west from the Somali Plate to the east. One hypothesis proposes the existence of a mantle plume beneath the Afar region, whereas an opposing hypothesis asserts that the rifting is merely a zone of maximum weakness where the African Plate is deforming as plates to its east are moving rapidly northward. The African Plate's speed is estimated at around 2.15 cm (0.85 in) per year. It has been moving over the past 100 million years or so in a general northeast direction. This is drawing it closer to the Eurasian Plate, causing subduction where oceanic crust is converging with continental crust (e.g. portions of the central and eastern Mediterranean). In the western Mediterranean, the relative motions of the Eurasian and African plates produce a combination of lateral and compressive forces, concentrated in a zone known as the Azores–Gibraltar Fault Zone. Along its northeast margin, the African Plate is bounded by the Red Sea Rift where the Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate. The New England hotspot in the Atlantic Ocean has probably created a short line of mid- to late-Tertiary age seamounts on the African Plate but appears to be currently inactive. \"Sizes of Tectonic or Lithospheric Plates\".

      "  The word actinism is found, for example, in the terminology of imaging technology (esp. photography), medicine (concerning sunburn), and chemistry (concerning containers that protect from photo-degradation), and the concept of actinism is applied, for example, in chemical photography and X-ray imaging. Actinic (/ækˈtɪnɪk/) chemicals include silver salts used in photography and other light sensitive chemicals. In chemical terms, actinism is the property of radiation that lets it be absorbed by a molecule and cause a photochemical reaction as a result. Albert Einstein was the first to correctly theorize that each photon would be able to cause only one molecular reaction. This distinction separates photochemical reactions from exothermic reduction reactions triggered by radiation. For general purposes, photochemistry is the commonly used vernacular rather than actinic or actino-chemistry, which are again more commonly seen used for photography or imaging. In medicine, actinic effects are generally described in terms of the dermis or outer layers of the body, such as eyes (see: Actinic conjunctivitis) and upper tissues that the sun would normally affect, rather than deeper tissues that higher-energy shorter-wavelength radiation such as x-ray and gamma might affect. Actinic is also used to describe medical conditions that are triggered by exposure to light, especially UV light (see actinic keratosis). The term actinic rays is used to refer to this phenomenon. In biology, actinic light denotes light from solar or other sources that can cause photochemical reactions such as photosynthesis in a species. Actinic light was first commonly used in early photography to distinguish light that would expose the monochrome films from light that would not. A non-actinic safe-light (e.g., red or amber) could be used in a darkroom without risk of exposing (fogging) light-sensitive films, plates or papers. Early \"non colour-sensitive\" (NCS) films, plates and papers were only sensitive to the high-energy end of the visible spectrum from green to UV (shorter-wavelength light). This would render a print of the red areas as a very dark tone because the red light was not actinic. Typically, light from xenon flash lamps is highly actinic, as is daylight as both contain significant green-to-UV light. In the first half of the 20th century, developments in film technology produced films sensitive to red and yellow light, known as orthochromatic and panchromatic, and extended that through to near infra-red light. These gave a truer reproduction of human perception of lightness across the color spectrum. In photography, therefore, actinic light must now be referenced to the photographic material in question. Actinic inspection of masks in computer chip manufacture refers to inspecting the mask with the same wavelength of light that the lithography system will use. Actinic lights are also common in the reef aquarium industry. They are used to promote coral and invertebrate growth. They are also used to accentuate the fluorescence of fluorescent fish. Actinic lighting is also used to limit algae growth in the aquarium. Since algae (like many other plants), flourish in shallower warm water, algae cannot effectively photosynthesize from blue and violet light, thus actinic light minimizes its photosynthetic benefit. Actinic lighting is also a great alternative to black lights as it provides a \"night environment\" for the fish, while still allowing enough light for coral and other marine life to grow. Aesthetically, they make fluorescent coral \"pop\" to the eye, but in some cases also to promote the growth of deeper-water coral adapted to photosynthesis in regions of the ocean dominated by blue light. \"Actinic\" lights are a high-color-temperature blue light. They are also used in electric fly killers to attract flies. Spectral sensitivity is commonly used to describe the actinic responsivity of photographic materials.

      "  With the Sun as center, it is known as Copernican. The flag of Portugal features an armillary sphere. The armillary sphere is also featured in Portuguese heraldry, associated with the Portuguese discoveries during the Age of Exploration. Manuel I of Portugal, for example, took it as one of his symbols where it appeared on his standard, and on early Chinese export ceramics made for the Portuguese court. In the flag of the Empire of Brazil, the armillary sphere is also featured. The Beijing Capital International Airport Terminal 3 features a large armillary sphere metal sculpture as an exhibit of Chinese inventions for international and domestic visitors. The exterior parts of this machine are a compages [or framework] of brass rings, which represent the principal circles of the heavens. The equinoctial A, which is divided into 360 degrees (beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in Aries) for showing the sun's right ascension in degrees; and also into 24 hours, for showing its right ascension in time. The ecliptic B, which is divided into 12 signs, and each sign into 30 degrees, and also into the months and days of the year; in such a manner, that the degree or point of the ecliptic in which the sun is, on any given day, stands over that day in the circle of months. The tropic of Cancer C, touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Cancer in e, and the tropic of Capricorn D, touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Capricorn in f; each 231⁄2 degrees from the equinoctial circle. The Arctic Circle E, and the Antarctic Circle F, each 231⁄2 degrees from its respective pole at N and S. The equinoctial colure G, passing through the north and south poles of the heaven at N and S, and through the equinoctial points Aries and Libra, in the ecliptic. The solstitial colure H, passing through the poles of the heaven, and through the solstitial points Cancer and Capricorn, in the ecliptic. Each quarter of the former of these colures is divided into 90 degrees, from the equinoctial to the poles of the world, for showing the declination of the sun, moon, and stars; and each quarter of the latter, from the ecliptic as e and f, to its poles b and d, for showing the latitude of the stars. In the north pole of the ecliptic is a nut b, to which is fixed one end of the quadrantal wire, and to the other end a small sun Y, which is carried round the ecliptic B—B, by turning the nut : and in the south pole of the ecliptic is a pin d, on which is another quadrantal wire, with a small moon Ζ upon it, which may be moved round by hand : but there is a particular contrivance for causing the moon to move in an orbit which crosses the ecliptic at an angle of 51⁄3 degrees, to opposite points called the moon's nodes; and also for shifting these points backward in the ecliptic, as the moon's nodes shift in the heaven. Within these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe I, fixed on an axis K, which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s, to those of the celestial sphere at N and S. On this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian L L, which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe, so as to keep over the same meridian upon it. This flat meridian is graduated the same way as the brass meridian of the common globe, and its use is much the same. To this globe is fitted the movable horizon M, so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe, and entering the globe at the opposite points off its equator, which is a movable brass ring set into the globe in a groove all around its equator. The globe may be turned by hand within this ring, so as to place any given meridian upon it, directly under the celestial meridian L. The horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge, within which are the points of the compass, for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon, both in degrees and points. The celestial meridian L passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon, as in a common globe: both here, if the globe be turned round, the horizon and meridian turn with it. At the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours, fixed to the rings, and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle, if the globe be turned round its axis. The whole fabric is supported on a pedestal N, and may be elevated or depressed upon the joint O, to any number of degrees from 0 to 90, by means of the arc P, which is fixed in the strong brass arm Q, and slides in the upright piece R, in which is a screw at r, to fix it at any proper elevation. In the box T are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two pinions, whose axes come out at V and U; either of which may be turned by the small winch W. When the winch is put upon the axis V, and turn backward, the terrestrial globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun Y, and moon Z, round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis U, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index. And so, by this construction, the machine is equally fitted to show either the real motion of the earth, or the apparent motion of the heavens. To rectify the sphere for use, first slacken the screw r in the upright stem R, and taking hold of the arm Q, move it up or down until the given degree of latitude for any place be at the side of the stem R; and then the axis of the sphere will be properly elevated, so as to stand parallel to the axis of the world, if the machine be set north and south by a small compass: this done, count the latitude from the north pole, upon the celestial meridian L, down towards the north notch of the horizon, and set the horizon to that latitude; then, turn the nut b until the sun Y comes to the given day of the year in the ecliptic, and the sun will be at its proper place for that day: find the place of the moon's ascending node, and also the place of the moon, by an Ephemeris, and set them right accordingly: lastly, turn the winch W, until either the sun comes to the meridian L, or until the meridian comes to the sun (according as you want the sphere or earth to move) and set the hour-index to the XII, marked noon, and the whole machine will be rectified. — Then turn the winch, and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon, and the hour-index will show the times thereof for the given day. Throughout Chinese history, astronomers have created celestial globes (Chinese: 渾象) to assist the observation of the stars. The Chinese also used the armillary sphere in aiding calendrical computations and calculations. According to Joseph Needham, the earliest development of the armillary sphere in China goes back to the astronomers Shi Shen and Gan De in the 4th century BC, as they were equipped with a primitive single-ring armillary instrument. This would have allowed them to measure the north polar distance (declination) a measurement that gave the position in a xiu (right ascension). Needham's 4th century BC dating, however, is rejected by British sinologist Christopher Cullen, who traces the beginnings of these devices to the 1st century BC. During the Western Han dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD) additional developments made by the astronomers Luoxia Hong (落下閎), Xiangyu Wangren, and Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) advanced the use of the armillary in its early stage of evolution. In 52 BC, it was the astronomer Geng Shouchang who introduced the first permanently fixed equatorial ring of the armillary sphere. In the subsequent Eastern Han dynasty (23–220 AD) period, the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring by 84 AD. With the famous statesman, astronomer, and inventor Zhang Heng (張衡, 78–139 AD), the sphere was totally complete in 125 AD, with horizon and meridian rings\n",

      "  The use of Raman spectroscopy is growing for more specialist applications. There are also derivative methods such as infrared microscopy, which allows very small areas to be analyzed in an optical microscope. One method of elemental analysis that is important in forensic analysis is energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) performed in the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The method involves analysis of back-scattered X-rays from the sample as a result of interaction with the electron beam. Automated EDX is further used in a range of automated mineralogy techniques for identification and textural mapping. In all three spectroscopic methods, the sample usually needs to be present in solution, which may present problems during forensic examination because it necessarily involves sampling solid from the object to be examined. In FTIR, three types of samples can be analyzed: solution (KBr), powder, or film. A solid film is the easiest and most straight forward sample type to test. Many polymer degradation mechanisms can be followed using IR spectroscopy, such as UV degradation and oxidation, among many other failure modes. Many polymers are attacked by UV radiation at vulnerable points in their chain structures. Thus, polypropylene suffers severe cracking in sunlight unless anti-oxidants are added. The point of attack occurs at the tertiary carbon atom present in every repeat unit, causing oxidation and finally chain breakage. Polyethylene is also susceptible to UV degradation, especially those variants that are branched polymers such as low-density polyethylene. The branch points are tertiary carbon atoms, so polymer degradation starts there and results in chain cleavage, and embrittlement. In the example shown at left, carbonyl groups were readily detected by IR spectroscopy from a cast thin film. The product was a road cone that had cracked in service, and many similar cones also failed because an anti-UV additive had not been used. Polymers are susceptible to attack by atmospheric oxygen, especially at elevated temperatures encountered during processing to shape. Many process methods such as extrusion and injection moulding involve pumping molten polymer into tools, and the high temperatures needed for melting may result in oxidation unless precautions are taken. For example, a forearm crutch suddenly snapped and the user was severely injured in the resulting fall. The crutch had fractured across a polypropylene insert within the aluminium tube of the device, and IR spectroscopy of the material showed that it had oxidised, possibly as a result of poor moulding. Oxidation is usually relatively easy to detect, owing to the strong absorption by the carbonyl group in the spectrum of polyolefins. Polypropylene has a relatively simple spectrum, with few peaks at the carbonyl position (like polyethylene). Oxidation tends to start at tertiary carbon atoms because free radicals here are more stable, so last longer and are attacked by oxygen. The carbonyl group can be further oxidised to break the chain, so weakening the material by lowering the molecular weight, and cracks start to grow in the regions affected. The reaction occurring between double bonds and ozone is known as ozonolysis when one molecule of the gas reacts with the double bond: The immediate result is formation of an ozonide, which then decomposes rapidly so that the double bond is cleaved. This is the critical step in chain breakage when polymers are attacked. The strength of polymers depends on the chain molecular weight or degree of polymerization: The higher the chain length the greater the mechanical strength (such as tensile strength). By cleaving the chain, the molecular weight drops rapidly and there comes a point when it has little strength whatsoever, and a crack forms. Further attack occurs in the freshly exposed crack surfaces and the crack grows steadily until it completes a circuit and the product separates or fails. In the case of a seal or a tube, failure occurs when the wall of the device is penetrated. The carbonyl end groups that are formed are usually aldehydes or ketones, which can oxidise further to carboxylic acids. The net result is a high concentration of elemental oxygen on the crack surfaces, which can be detected using EDX in the ESEM. For example, two EDX spectra were obtained during an investigation into ozone cracking of diaphragm seals in a semiconductor fabrication factory. The EDX spectrum of the crack surface shows the high-oxygen peak compared with a constant sulfur peak. In contrast, the EDX spectrum of the unaffected elastomer surface spectrum shows a relatively low-oxygen peak compared with the sulfur peak.

      "  The Alpine orogeny is caused by the continents Africa, Arabia and India and the small Cimmerian Plate colliding (from the south) with Eurasia in the north. Convergent movements between the tectonic plates (the African Plate, the Arabian Plate and the Indian Plate from the south, the Eurasian Plate from the north, and many smaller plates and microplates) had already begun in the early Cretaceous, but the major phases of mountain building began in the Paleocene to Eocene. The process continues currently in some of the Alpide mountain ranges.[citation needed] The Alpine orogeny is considered one of the three major phases of orogeny in Europe that define the geology of that continent, along with the Caledonian orogeny that formed the Old Red Sandstone Continent when the continents Baltica and Laurentia collided in the early Paleozoic, and the Hercynian or Variscan orogeny that formed Pangaea when Gondwana and the Old Red Sandstone Continent collided in the middle to late Paleozoic.[citation needed] These mountains include (from west to east) the Atlas, the Rif, the Baetic Cordillera, the Cantabrian Mountains, the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Apennine Mountains, the Dinaric Alps, the Albanian Alps (Albanides), the Pindus (Hellenides), the Carpathians, the Balkanides (the Balkan Mountains and Rila-Rhodope massifs), the Pontic Mountains, the Taurus, the Antitaurus, the Armenian Highlands, the Caucasus, the Alborz, the Zagros, the Hajar, the Hindu Kush, the Pamir, the Karakoram, and the Himalayas. Sometimes other names occur to describe the formation of separate mountain ranges: for example Carpathian orogeny for the Carpathians, Hellenic orogeny for the Pindus, Altai orogeny for the Altai Mountains or the Himalayan orogeny for the Himalayas. The Alpine orogeny has also led to the formation of more distant and smaller geological features such as the Weald–Artois Anticline in Southern England and northern France, the remains of which can be seen in the chalk ridges of the North and South Downs in southern England. Its effects are particularly visible on the Isle of Wight, where the Chalk Group and overlying Eocene strata are folded to near-vertical, as seen in exposures at Alum Bay and Whitecliff Bay, and on the Dorset coast near Lulworth Cove.

      "  In his department at Johns Hopkins Hospital, he enforced an extreme hand washing ritual consisting of soaking in harmfully strong chemicals like permanganate and mercury bichloride solution as well as scrubbing with stiff brushes. The damage to a surgical nurse's hands compelled him to create the earliest form of the surgical gloves with the Goodyear Rubber Company. These gloves became a part of the aseptic surgery standard when Dr. Joseph Colt Bloodgood and several others began wearing them for that particular purpose. The line between antisepsis and asepsis is interpreted differently, depending on context and time. In the past, antiseptic operations occurred in people's homes or in operating theaters before a large crowd. Procedures for implementing antisepsis varied among physicians and experienced constant changes. Until the late 19th century, physicians rejected the connection between Louis Pasteur's germ theory that bacteria caused diseases and antiseptic techniques. At the end of the 19th century, Joseph Lister and his followers expanded the term \"antisepsis\" and coined \"asepsis,\" with the justification that Lister had initially \"suggested excluding septic agents from the wound from the start.\" Generally, however, asepsis is seen as a continuation of antisepsis since many of the values are the same, such as a \"germ-free environment around the wound or patient,\" and techniques pioneered under both names are used in conjunction today. Asepsis refers to any procedure that is performed under sterile conditions. This includes medical and laboratory techniques (such as with bacterial cultures). There are two types of asepsis – medical and surgical. Medical or clean asepsis reduces the number of organisms and prevents their spread; surgical or sterile asepsis includes procedures to eliminate micro-organisms from an area and is practiced by surgical technologists and nurses. Ultimately, though, successful usage of aseptic operations depends on a combination of preparatory actions. For example, sterile equipment and fluids are used during invasive medical and nursing procedures. The largest manifestation of such aseptic techniques is in hospital operating theaters, where the aim is to keep patients free from hospital micro-organisms. While all members of the surgical team should demonstrate good aseptic technique, it is the role of the scrub nurse or surgical technologist to set up and maintain the sterile field. To prevent cross-contamination of patients, instruments are sterilized through autoclaving or by using disposable equipment; suture material or xenografts also need to be sterilized beforehand. Basic aseptic procedures includes hand washing, donning protective gloves, masks and gowns, and sterilizing equipment and linens. Medical aseptic techniques also includes curbing the spread of infectious diseases through quarantine, specifically isolation procedures based on the mode of disease transmission. Within contact, droplet and airborne isolation methods, two different procedures emerge: strict isolation vs. reverse isolation. Strict isolation quarantines patients to prevent them from infecting others, while reverse isolation prevents vulnerable patients from becoming infected. In aseptic conditions, a \"chronic low-level inflammation\" known as sterile inflammation may develop as a result of trauma, stress, or environmental factors. As in infections caused by pathogens or microbes, the immune response is regulated by host receptors. Tissue damage resulting from non-infectious means are caused by DAMPs molecules released after injury or cell death has occurred, which are able to stimulate inflammation response. Diseases associated with sterile inflammation include Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, as well as cancer tumor growth due to \"immune cell infiltration.\" Additionally, aseptic tissue damage may arise from corticosteroid injections, which are drugs used to treat musculoskeletal conditions such as carpal tunnel and osteoarthritis, though this tends to result from improper aseptic technique. Despite efforts to preserve asepsis during surgery, there still persists a 1-3% chance of a surgical site infection (SSI). Infections are categorized as superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ; the first type are confined to the skin, the second to muscles and nearby tissues, and the third to organs not anatomically close to the operation site. The exact modes of infection depend on the types of surgery, but the most common bacteria that are responsible for SSIs are Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. The CDC emphasizes the importance of both antiseptic and aseptic approaches in avoiding SSIs, especially since Staphylococcus aureus, among other bacteria, are able to evolve drug-resistant strains that can be difficult to treat. In 2017, nearly 20,000 patients in the United States died from Staphylococcus aureus in comparison to the 16,350 from diagnosed HIV.

      " At the end of the 19th century, Joseph Lister and his followers expanded the term \"antisepsis\" and coined \"asepsis,\" with the justification that Lister had initially \"suggested excluding septic agents from the wound from the start.\" Generally, however, asepsis is seen as a continuation of antisepsis since many of the values are the same, such as a \"germ-free environment around the wound or patient,\" and techniques pioneered under both names are used in conjunction today. Asepsis refers to any procedure that is performed under sterile conditions. This includes medical and laboratory techniques (such as with bacterial cultures) There are two types of asepsis – medical and surgical. Medical or clean asepsis reduces the number of organisms and prevents their spread; surgical or sterile asepsis includes procedures to eliminate micro-organisms from an area and is practiced by surgical technologists and nurses.\n",

      " 7 MeV cyclotron designed to function as the proton injector was completed in 1955, and the large homopolar generator intended to power the system was first operated in 1962, but by this time work on \"The Big Machine\" itself had been abandoned. The homopolar generator, the largest ever built, was capable of supplying currents of over 2 megaamperes. Even though it was never used for its intended purpose it ended up being used for numerous research projects requiring an extremely high current source until its disassembly in 1986. One of these projects was the invention and development of the railgun by John Barber and Richard Marshall. The school also benefited in an indirect way from the construction of the massive generator, the accumulated engineering experience and techniques where later used to build other research equipment around the school including the Plasma Physics H1NF Heliac. Some parts of the homopolar generator are now on permanent display on the lawn outside the research school. The school has been home to many different particle accelerators over the years. The first accelerator installed was a 1.25 MV Cockcroft-Walton known as HT1, this was in use from 1952 until 1967 when it was sold to the University of New South Wales. A second smaller 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton machine (HT2) was assembled in house using many spare parts acquired for HT1. In 1955 the UK government supplied a 33 MeV electron synchrotron as a gift. It was moved to the University of Western Australia in 1961. During 1960–1980 a HVEC EN tandem accelerator was used by nuclear physics for light ion research. 1975 saw the school's 14UD accelerator come online, which has since been augmented with a superconducting linear accelerator. On 5 July 1960 a fire during the night destroyed much of the eastern end of the Cockcroft Building. The damage included the drawing office, many student's and staff's results and files and the control room for the 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator. The 600 kV accelerator though only water damaged had to be scrapped. Refurbishment of the burnt out area was completed in September 1961. Early departments that have now been spun off into research schools of their own include the departments of Astronomy and Geophysics and Geochemistry. Geophysics and Geochemistry separated into the Research School of Earth Sciences in 1973. Mount Stromlo Observatory became part of the Department of Astronomy in 1957. While part of the school, the Department of Astronomy developed Siding Spring Observatory and installed many new telescopes at Mount Stromlo Observatory. It separated into the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1986.

      "  Subsequently, he was educated in England at Mowden Hall School and Winchester College. Jameson served as a lieutenant in the British Army in 1953–1955, and was sent to Malaya. On coming out of the army he worked in the compressor design section of Bristol Aero-Engines in the summer of 1955, before studying engineering at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Jameson graduated with first class honours in 1958. Subsequently, he stayed on at Cambridge to obtain a PhD in Magnetohydrodynamics, and he was a Research Fellow of Trinity Hall from 1960 to 1963. On leaving Cambridge he worked as an economist for the Trades Union Congress in 1964–1965. He then became Chief Mathematician at Hawker Siddeley in Coventry. In 1966, Jameson joined the Aerodynamics Section of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation in Bethpage, New York. In this period, his work was largely directed toward the application of automatic control theory to stability augmentation systems. Starting in 1970, he began to concentrate on the problem of predicting transonic flow. Existing numerical methods were not equal to the task, and it was clear that new methods would have to be developed. At that time limitations in computer capabilities also precluded any attempt to calculate the flow past a complete aircraft, but useful efforts could be made for simpler configurations such as airfoils and wings. In 1972 Jameson moved to the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, where he continued his work on transonic flow. In 1974 he was appointed Professor of Computer Science at New York University. He joined Princeton University in 1980, and in 1982 he was appointed James Smith McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. He was Director of the University's Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics from 1986 to 1988. He was a Professor of Engineering in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics from 1997–2015, Stanford University. He is currently Jack E. & Frances Brown I Chair in Engineering in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University. During his career, Professor Jameson has devised a variety of new schemes for solving the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for inviscid and viscous compressible flows. For example, he devised a multigrid-scheme for the solution of steady flow problems and the dual time stepping scheme for unsteady flows. Jameson also wrote the FLO and SYN series of computer programs which have been widely used in the aircraft industry. In 1980 he received the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement in recognition of his earlier work on transonic potential flow. In 1988 he received the Gold Medal of the British Royal Aeronautical Society for his outstanding contribution to the development of methods for the calculation of transonic flow over real aircraft configurations. In 1991 he was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and he was also elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs that decorate the temple, from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed the restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005 Microbial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at Angkor Wat, Preah Khan, and the Bayon and West Prasat in Angkor.\n",

      "  Honderich then points out that what we are really doing when we say that there is \"no lawlike relationship between two things under certain descriptions\" is taking certain properties and noting that the two things are not in relation in virtue of those particular properties. But this does not mean they are not in lawlike relation in virtue of certain other properties, such as weight in the pears example. On this basis, we can formulate the generalization that Honderich calls 'the Nomological Character of Causally-Relevant Properties'. Then we ask what the causally relevant properties of the mental events which cause physical events are. Since Davidson believes that mental events are causally efficacious (i.e. he rejects epiphenomenalism), then it must be a mental event as such (mental properties of mental events) which are the causally relevant properties. But if we accept the first two claims of the argument for AM, along with the idea of the causal efficacy of the mental, and the Principle of Causally-Relevant properties, then the result is a denial of anomalous monism because there are indeed psycho-physical lawlike connections. On the other hand, if we wish to retain the principle of the anomalism of the mental then we must reject causal efficacy and embrace epiphenomenalism. Davidson has responded to such arguments by reformulating anomalous monism and has defended the improved version in Thinking Causes. He points out that the defect in the so-called epiphenominalism problem lies in its confusion of the concept \"by virtue of\" (or necessary for) with the idea of an event's being responsible for another. Also, Honderich's example of the pears and the scale is jerry rigged in such a way that only a single effect is taken into consideration: the alteration on the scale. But the action of placing pears on a scale can have many different effects; it can attract the attention of a customer, for example. In this case, the causally relevant properties would be precisely the color, shape and other irrelevant properties of the fruit. What is relevant or irrelevant therefore depends, in part, on the context of explanatory interest. Biological naturalism Neutral monism Donald Davidson (2001). \"Anomalous monism\".

      " \" The medievalist scholar M. R. James considered the Aberdeen Bestiary ''a replica of Ashmole 1511\" a view echoed by many other art historians. The original patron of both the Aberdeen and Ashmole Bestiary was considered to be a high-ranking member of society such as a prince, king or another high ranking church official or monastery. However, since the section related to monastery life that was commonly depicted within the Aviarium manuscript was missing the original patron remains uncertain but it appears less likely to be a church member. The Aberdeen Bestiary was kept in Church and monastic settings for a majority of its history. However at some point it entered into the English royal collections library. The royal Westminster Library shelf stamp of King Henry the VIII is stamped on the side of the bestiary. How King Henry acquired the manuscript remains unknown although it was probably taken from a monastery. The manuscript appears to have been well-read by the family based on the amount of reading wear on the edges of the pages. Around the time King James of Scotland became the King of England the bestiary was passed along to the Marischal College, Aberdeen. The manuscript is in fragmented condition as many illuminations on folios were removed individually as miniatures likely not for monetary but possibly for personal reasons. The manuscript currently is in the Aberdeen Library in Scotland where it has remained since 1542. The Aberdeen bestiary is a gilded decorated manuscript featuring large miniatures and some of the finest pigment, parchment and gold leaf from its time. Some portions of the manuscript such as folio eight recto even feature tarnished silver leaf. The original patron was wealthy enough to afford such materials so that the artists and scribes could enjoy creative freedom while creating the manuscripts. The artists were professionally trained and experimented with new techniques - such as heavy washes mixed with light washes and dark thick lines and use of contrasting color. The aqua color that is in the Aberdeen Bestiary is not present in the Ashmole Bestiary. The Aberdeen manuscript is loaded with filigree flora design and champie style gold leaf initials. Canterbury is considered to be the original location of manufacture as the location was well known for manufacturing high-end luxury books during the thirteen century. Its similarities with the Canterbury Paris Psalter tree style also further draws evidence of this relation. The craftsmanship of both Ashmole and Aberdeen bestiary suggest similar artists and scribes. Both the Ashmole and Aberdeen bestiary were probably made within 10 years of each other due to their stylistic and material similarities and the fact that both are crafted with the finest materials of their time. Stylistically both manuscripts are very similar but the Aberdeen has figures that are both more voluminous and less energetic than those of the Ashmole Bestiary. The color usage has been suggested as potentially Biblical in meaning as color usage had different interpretations in the early 13th century. The overall style of the human figures as well as color usage is very reminiscent of Roman mosaic art especially with the attention to detail in the drapery. Circles and ovals semi-realistically depict highlights throughout the manuscript. The way that animals are shaded in a Romanesque fashion with the use of bands to depict volume and form, which is similar to an earlier 12th-century Bury Bible made at Bury St.Edmunds. This Bestiary also shows stylistic similarities with the Paris Psalters of Canterbury. The Aviary section is similar to the Aviariium which is a well-known 12th century monastic text. The deviation from traditional color usage can be seen in the tiger, satyr, and unicorn folios as well as many other folios. The satyr in the Aberdeen Bestiary when compared to the satyr section of the slightly older Worksop bestiary is almost identical. There are small color notes in the Aberdeen Bestiary that are often seen in similar manuscripts dating between 1175 and 1250 which help indicate that it was made near the year 1200 or 1210. These notes are similar to many other side notes written on the sides of pages throughout the manuscript and were probably by the painter to remind himself of special circumstances, these note occur irregularly throughout the text. Folio page 1 to 3 recto depicts the Genesis 1:1-25 which is represented with a large full page illumination Biblical Creation scene in the manuscript. Folio 5 recto shows Adam, a large figure surrounded by gold leaf and towering over others, with the theme of 'Adam naming the animals' - this starts the compilation of the bestiary portion within the manuscript. Folio 5 verso depicts quadrupeds, livestock, wild beasts, and the concept of the herd. Folio 7 to 18 recto depicts large cats and other beasts such as wolves, foxes and dogs. Many pages from the start of the manuscript's bestiary section such as 11 verso featuring a hyena shows small pin holes which were likely used to map out and copy artwork to a new manuscript\n",

      "  Subsequently, in 1988, he joined the Training School Program at BARC, Mumbai, India. Originally from the state of Odisha in India, Pati obtained his PhD from the University of Bombay, Mumbai. In 1989, he took up a position as a theoretical physicist in the Theoretical Physics Division, BARC, Mumbai, India. Since 1989, he has been working on quantum theory, quantum computing and quantum information. From 1998 to 2000, he was a visiting scientist and an EPSRC fellow at the University of Wales, Bangor, UK. He was a visiting scientist at the Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, India from 2001 to 2010. He was a professor of quantum information at the Harish Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad, India since 2011. He is honored with K. P. Chair Professorship at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China during the period 2013–2015. He is an adjunct professor at IISER, Mohali. Currently, he is leading the Center for Quantum Science and Technology (CQST),at IIIT, Hyderabad. He is also Director of Quantum Ecosystem and Technology Council of India (QETCI). Along with Samuel L. Braunstein, he proved the quantum no-deleting theorem. Similar to the no-cloning theorem, the no-deleting theorem is a fundamental consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics. This proves that given two copies of an unknown quantum state we cannot delete one copy. The no-cloning and the no-deleting theorems suggest that we can neither create nor destroy quantum information. His other important collaborative work with Braunstein includes the quantum no-hiding theorem. This states that if quantum information is lost from one subsystem then it remains in the rest of the universe and cannot be hidden in the quantum correlation between the original system and the environment. This has applications that include quantum teleportation, quantum state randomization, thermalization and the black hole information loss paradox. The no-hiding theorem has been experimentally tested and this is a clear demonstration of the conservation of quantum information. Pati also discovered the remote state preparation (RSP) protocol in quantum information theory. This is an important quantum communication scheme similar to quantum teleportation. In RSP protocol, Alice can prepare a known qubit chosen from special ensemble at Bob's location using a maximally entangled state and one bit of classical communication. This has been experimentally tested by several groups. Pati along with Artur Ekert, Vlatko Vedral and other scientists have introduced the concept of geometric phase for mixed states. This has been experimentally measured by several groups around the world. In another fundamental work, Pati along with L. Maccone have discovered stronger uncertainty relations that go beyond the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. These new relations capture the notion of incompatible observables and show that quantum world is more uncertain than what Heisenberg-Robertson's uncertainty relation has explicated us. Pati is the recipient of the India Physics Association Award for Young Physicist of the Year (2000) and the Indian Physical Society Awards for Young Scientists (1996). He is also recipient of Samanta Chandra Sekhar Award for the year 2009 from Orissa Bigyan Academy, Bhubaneswar, Odisha. He is an elected Fellow of the Indian Academy of Science, Bangalore. He also has been elected as the Fellow of The National Academy of Sciences, India in 2013.

Prideaux John Selby, an ornithologist and natural history artist, wrote to Jardine after receiving the first part to say how impressed he was with the beautifully executed woodcuts and the quality of the printing, and later, when he had the complete set, said to the same recipient that it was a \"very beautiful work\", although a few of the fish could have been better illustrated. Jardine himself published an enthusiastic review in his Magazine of Botany and Zoology. A History of British Fishes and the later A History of British Birds were both immediately commercially successful and became standard texts until the end of the nineteenth century. Van Voorst believed that Yarrell made around £4000 from the two books. Yarrell's name is commemorated in eight species, three of which are fish. These are Yarrell's blenny (Chirolophis ascanii), from the European North Atlantic coasts; the giant devil catfish, Bagarius yarrelli, from the rivers of the Indian subcontinent; and Laemonema yarrellii, a deep sea morid cod from Madeira and the Great Meteor Seamount of the North Atlantic. The lightfish genus Yarrella is also named for him. £109,400 at 2022 values.

Yarrell had seen Cuban specimens kept in rum, but cautioned against the use of gin, which was usually too dilute to be effective. Although Bewick's Birds is specifically British, it is considered to be the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick had planned to write a book on British fishes, but neither he nor his son, Robert, completed the project. £12.52 at 2022 values calculated using MeasuringWorth for 1836 About £400,000 at 2022 values, calculated using MeasuringWorth over the period 1836–1856 Edwards, JC (2004). \"Yarrell, William\".

      "  This value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of network output, assuming a normal distribution. A confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified. By assigning a softmax activation function, a generalization of the logistic function, on the output layer of the neural network (or a softmax component in a component-based network) for categorical target variables, the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities. This is useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications. The softmax activation function is: y i = e x i ∑ j = 1 c e x j {\\displaystyle y_{i}={\\frac {e^{x_{i}}}{\\sum _{j=1}^{c}e^{x_{j}}}}} A common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they require too much training for real-world operation. Potential solutions include randomly shuffling training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example, grouping examples in so-called mini-batches and/or introducing a recursive least squares algorithm for CMAC. A central claim[citation needed] of ANNs is that they embody new and powerful general principles for processing information. These principles are ill-defined. It is often claimed[by whom?] that they are emergent from the network itself. This allows simple statistical association (the basic function of artificial neural networks) to be described as learning or recognition. In 1997, Alexander Dewdney commented that, as a result, artificial neural networks have a \"something-for-nothing quality, one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are. No human hand (or mind) intervenes; solutions are found as if by magic; and no one, it seems, has learned anything\". One response to Dewdney is that neural networks handle many complex and diverse tasks, ranging from autonomously flying aircraft to detecting credit card fraud to mastering the game of Go. Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented: Neural networks, for instance, are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven, (what hasn't?) but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked: the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be \"an opaque, unreadable table...valueless as a scientific resource\". In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology, Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers. An unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having. Biological brains use both shallow and deep circuits as reported by brain anatomy, displaying a wide variety of invariance. Weng argued that the brain self-wires largely according to signal statistics and therefore, a serial cascade cannot catch all major statistical dependencies. Large and effective neural networks require considerable computing resources. While the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a simplified neuron on von Neumann architecture may consume vast amounts of memory and storage. Furthermore, the designer often needs to transmit signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons – which require enormous CPU power and time. Schmidhuber noted that the resurgence of neural networks in the twenty-first century is largely attributable to advances in hardware: from 1991 to 2015, computing power, especially as delivered by GPGPUs (on GPUs), has increased around a million-fold, making the standard backpropagation algorithm feasible for training networks that are several layers deeper than before. The use of accelerators such as FPGAs and GPUs can reduce training times from months to days. Neuromorphic engineering or a physical neural network addresses the hardware difficulty directly, by constructing non-von-Neumann chips to directly implement neural networks in circuitry. Another type of chip optimized for neural network processing is called a Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU. Analyzing what has been learned by an ANN is much easier than analyzing what has been learned by a biological neural network. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, local vs. non-local learning and shallow vs. deep architecture. Advocates of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches) say that such a mixture can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind.

This allows for the determination of the amount of a chemical in a material by comparing the results of an unknown sample to those of a series of known standards. If the concentration of element or compound in a sample is too high for the detection range of the technique, it can simply be diluted in a pure solvent. If the amount in the sample is below an instrument's range of measurement, the method of addition can be used. In this method, a known quantity of the element or compound under study is added, and the difference between the concentration added and the concentration observed is the amount actually in the sample. Sometimes an internal standard is added at a known concentration directly to an analytical sample to aid in quantitation. The amount of analyte present is then determined relative to the internal standard as a calibrant. An ideal internal standard is an isotopically enriched analyte which gives rise to the method of isotope dilution. The method of standard addition is used in instrumental analysis to determine the concentration of a substance (analyte) in an unknown sample by comparison to a set of samples of known concentration, similar to using a calibration curve. Standard addition can be applied to most analytical techniques and is used instead of a calibration curve to solve the matrix effect problem. One of the most important components of analytical chemistry is maximizing the desired signal while minimizing the associated noise. The analytical figure of merit is known as the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N or SNR). Noise can arise from environmental factors as well as from fundamental physical processes. Thermal noise results from the motion of charge carriers (usually electrons) in an electrical circuit generated by their thermal motion. Thermal noise is white noise meaning that the power spectral density is constant throughout the frequency spectrum. The root mean square value of the thermal noise in a resistor is given by v R M S = 4 k B T R Δ f , {\\displaystyle v_{\\rm {RMS}}={\\sqrt {4k_{\\rm {B}}TR\\Delta f}},} where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, R is the resistance, and Δ f {\\displaystyle \\Delta f} is the bandwidth of the frequency f {\\displaystyle f} . Shot noise is a type of electronic noise that occurs when the finite number of particles (such as electrons in an electronic circuit or photons in an optical device) is small enough to give rise to statistical fluctuations in a signal. Shot noise is a Poisson process, and the charge carriers that make up the current follow a Poisson distribution. The root mean square current fluctuation is given by i R M S = 2 e I Δ f {\\displaystyle i_{\\rm {RMS}}={\\sqrt {2eI\\Delta f}}} where e is the elementary charge and I is the average current. Shot noise is white noise. Flicker noise is electronic noise with a 1/ƒ frequency spectrum; as f increases, the noise decreases. Flicker noise arises from a variety of sources, such as impurities in a conductive channel, generation, and recombination noise in a transistor due to base current, and so on. This noise can be avoided by modulation of the signal at a higher frequency, for example, through the use of a lock-in amplifier. Environmental noise arises from the surroundings of the analytical instrument. Sources of electromagnetic noise are power lines, radio and television stations, wireless devices, compact fluorescent lamps and electric motors. Many of these noise sources are narrow bandwidth and, therefore, can be avoided. Temperature and vibration isolation may be required for some instruments. Noise reduction can be accomplished either in computer hardware or software. Examples of hardware noise reduction are the use of shielded cable, analog filtering, and signal modulation. Examples of software noise reduction are digital filtering, ensemble average, boxcar average, and correlation methods. Analytical chemistry has applications including in forensic science, bioanalysis, clinical analysis, environmental analysis, and materials analysis. Analytical chemistry research is largely driven by performance (sensitivity, detection limit, selectivity, robustness, dynamic range, linear range, accuracy, precision, and speed), and cost (purchase, operation, training, time, and space). Among the main branches of contemporary analytical atomic spectrometry, the most widespread and universal are optical and mass spectrometry. In the direct elemental analysis of solid samples, the new leaders are laser-induced breakdown and laser ablation mass spectrometry, and the related techniques with transfer of the laser ablation products into inductively coupled plasma. Advances in design of diode lasers and optical parametric oscillators promote developments in fluorescence and ionization spectrometry and also in absorption techniques where uses of optical cavities for increased effective absorption pathlength are expected to expand. The use of plasma- and laser-based methods is increasing. An interest towards absolute (standardless) analysis has revived, particularly in emission spectrometry.[citation needed] Great effort is being put into shrinking the analysis techniques to chip size\n",

      "  Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the mass defect of the nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the atomic mass of any atom, when expressed in daltons (making a quantity called the \"relative isotopic mass\"), is within 1% of the whole number A. Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers, and hence different mass numbers, are known as isotopes. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see monoisotopic elements), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard atomic weight. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century. The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl 'number', which, before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order was then approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this Z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word Atomzahl (and its English equivalent atomic number) come into common use in this context. The rules above do not always apply to exotic atoms which contain short-lived elementary particles other than protons, neutrons and electrons. Loosely speaking, the existence or construction of a periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements, and so they can be numbered in order. Dmitri Mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables (first published on March 6, 1869) in order of atomic weight (\"Atomgewicht\"). However, in consideration of the elements' observed chemical properties, he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium (atomic weight 127.6) ahead of iodine (atomic weight 126.9). This placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number, Z, but that number was not known or suspected at the time. A simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory, however. Besides the case of iodine and tellurium, later several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights, thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties. However the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements, whose atomic number was not obvious, led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium (element 71) onward (hafnium was not known at this time). In 1911, Ernest Rutherford gave a model of the atom in which a central nucleus held most of the atom's mass and a positive charge which, in units of the electron's charge, was to be approximately equal to half of the atom's atomic weight, expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms. This central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight (though it was almost 25% different from the atomic number of gold (Z = 79, A = 197), the single element from which Rutherford made his guess). Nevertheless, in spite of Rutherford's estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 (but was element Z = 79 on the periodic table), a month after Rutherford's paper appeared, Antonius van den Broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table (also known as element number, atomic number, and symbolized Z). This proved eventually to be the case. The experimental position improved dramatically after research by Henry Moseley in 1913. Moseley, after discussions with Bohr who was at the same lab (and who had used Van den Broek's hypothesis in his Bohr model of the atom), decided to test Van den Broek's and Bohr's hypothesis directly, by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the Bohr theory's postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of Z. To do this, Moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions (K and L lines) produced by the elements from aluminium (Z = 13) to gold (Z = 79) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an x-ray tube. The square root of the frequency of these photons (x-rays) increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression. This led to the conclusion (Moseley's law) that the atomic number does closely correspond (with an offset of one unit for K-lines, in Moseley's work) to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus, i.e. the element number Z. Among other things, Moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series (from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which was far from obvious from known chemistry at that time. After Moseley's death in 1915, the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium (Z = 92) were examined by his method. There were seven elements (with Z < 92) which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered, corresponding to atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, 87 and 91. From 1918 to 1947, all seven of these missing elements were discovered. By this time, the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered, so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium (Z = 96). In 1915, the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of Z, which were now recognized to be the same as the element number, was not understood. An old idea called Prout's hypothesis had postulated that the elements were all made of residues (or \"protyles\") of the lightest element hydrogen, which in the Bohr-Rutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one. However, as early as 1907, Rutherford and Thomas Royds had shown that alpha particles, which had a charge of +2, were the nuclei of helium atoms, which had a mass four times that of hydrogen, not two times. If Prout's hypothesis were true, something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms. In 1917, Rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen gas, and believed he had proven Prout's law. He called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 (alternate names being proutons and protyles). It had been immediately apparent from the work of Moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei, and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei. A helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two \"nuclear electrons\" (electrons bound inside the nucleus) to cancel two of the charges\n",

A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see monoisotopic elements), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard atomic weight. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century The conventional symbol Z comes from the German word Zahl 'number', which, before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the periodic table, whose order was then approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights.\n",

      " 00 but pitches in a ballpark favoring pitchers, then his ERA+ will be below 100. As a result, ERA+ can be used to compare pitchers across different run environments. In the above example, while ERA will lead one to believe that both pitchers pitched at the same level due to their ERAs being equivalent, ERA+ indicates that pitcher A performed better than pitcher B. ERA+ can thus be used to neutralize the effects of some well-known advantages and disadvantages on pitchers' ERA scores. Pedro Martínez holds the modern record for highest ERA+ in a single season; he posted a 1.74 ERA in the 2000 season while pitching in the American League, which had an average ERA of 4.92, which gave Martínez an ERA+ of 291. While Bob Gibson has the lowest ERA in modern times (1.12 in the National League in 1968), the average ERA was 2.99 that year (the so-called Year of the Pitcher) and so Gibson's ERA+ is 258, sixth highest since 1900. 1968 was the last year that Major League Baseball employed the use of a pitcher's mound higher than 10 inches (250 mm). The career record for ERA+ (with a minimum of 1,000 innings pitched) is held by Mariano Rivera, a closer whose career ERA+ is 205. Upon retirement in 2013, with an ERA+ of 194 in his final season, Rivera's career record of 205 surpassed the record among retired players of 154, held by Martínez, bumping Jim Devlin, a pitcher in the 1870s, to third with 151. Among qualifying pitchers, Pedro Martínez has the most separate seasons with an ERA+ over 200, with five, and the most consecutive 200 ERA+ seasons (4), though the closer Rivera, with too few innings each year to qualify officially, has surpassed 200 ERA+ in 13 seasons of his 19 seasons, including 4 consecutive seasons twice and 5 consecutive seasons once and also surpassing 300 in 2004 and again in 2008. Roger Clemens topped a 200 ERA+ three times, and Greg Maddux had two such seasons. Players in bold are active as of the end of the 2020 season and have not announced their retirement. Single-season leaders include only pitchers eligible for the ERA title (a pitcher must throw a minimum of one inning per game scheduled for his team during the season to qualify for the ERA title).

      "#Adjusted ERA+\n",
      "Adjusted ERA+, often simply abbreviated to ERA+ or ERA plus, is a pitching statistic in baseball. It adjusts a pitcher's earned run average (ERA) according to the pitcher's ballpark (in case the ballpark favors batters or pitchers) and the ERA of the pitcher's league. ERA+ is calculated as: E R A + = 100 ⋅ l g E R A E R A ⋅ P F {\\displaystyle {\\mathit {ERA+}}=100\\cdot {{\\mathit {lgERA}} \\over {\\mathit {ERA}}}\\cdot {\\mathit {PF}}} Where ERA is the pitcher's ERA, lgERA is the average ERA of the league, and PF is the park factor of the pitcher in question. This formula is now standard, although Baseball-Reference.com briefly used a different formula which took values strictly between 0 and 200 instead of between 0 and infinity, but the current website shows values above 200 so it is clearly no longer in use: E R A + = 100 ⋅ ( 2 − E R A l g E R A ⋅ 1 P F ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathit {ERA+}}=100\\cdot (2-{{\\mathit {ERA}} \\over {\\mathit {lgERA}}}\\cdot {1 \\over {\\mathit {PF}}})} The average ERA+ is set to be 100; a score above 100 indicates that the pitcher performed better than average, while below 100 indicates worse than average.\n",

      " Food sovereignty is a core component of agroecology that increases social power. The definition of food sovereignty as defined by La Via Campesina, the social movement that articulated it, is the following: \"Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It develops a model of small scale sustainable production benefiting communities and their environment. Food sovereignty prioritizes local food production and consumption, giving a country the right to protect its local producers from cheap imports and to control its production It includes the struggle for land and genuine agrarian reform that ensures that the rights to use and manage lands, territories, water, seeds, livestock, and biodiversity are in the hands of those who produce food and not of the corporate sector.\n",

      " The original analysis has been the subject of dispute in the literature. Trace fossils of these Avalon organisms have been found worldwide, with many found in Newfoundland, in Canada and the Charnwood Forest in England, representing the earliest known complex multicellular organisms. The Avalon explosion theoretically produced the Ediacaran biota. The biota largely disappeared contemporaneously with the rapid increase in biodiversity known as the Cambrian explosion At this time, all living animal groups were present in the Cambrian oceans. The Avalon explosion appears similar to the Cambrian explosion in the rapid increase in diversity of morphologies in a relatively small-time frame, followed by diversification within the established body plans, a pattern similar to that observed in other evolutionary events. The Avalon explosion was a time of early evolution and low diversity in species.\n",

      " A gene is considered to possess antagonistic pleiotropy if it controls more than one trait, where at least one of these traits is beneficial to the organism's fitness early on in life and at least one is detrimental to the organism's fitness later on due to a decline in the force of natural selection. The theme of G.C. William's idea about antagonistic pleiotropy was that if a gene caused both increased reproduction in early life and aging in later life, then senescence would be adaptive in evolution For example, one study suggests that since follicular depletion in human females causes both more regular cycles in early life and loss of fertility later in life through menopause, it can be selected for by having its early benefits outweigh its late costs.\n",

      "  In 1984, ASBMR leaders established The Osteoporosis Foundation, which was later renamed the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (JBMR), the official journal of the ASBMR, was established in 1986. Initially a bi-monthly publication, it became a monthly journal in 1990. Lawrence G. Raisz served as the first Editor-in-Chief of the JBMR. The ASBMR published the first edition of The Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism, a textbook for medical and graduate students, in 1990. Murray J. Favus served as the Editor-in-Chief for the first six editions of the Primer. The rise of new pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis in the 1990s, most notably the class of drugs known as bisphosphonates, gave rise to an influx of scientists and clinician-researchers into the field. This influx resulted in a dramatic increase in ASBMR membership and annual meeting attendance. During this period, the ASBMR expanded its advocacy endeavors targeted at U.S. government funding for bone research. The Society was a founding member of the National Coalition for Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases (\"Bone Coalition\") in 1991. ASBMR also became a member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). Though conceived as a scientific research society, in recent years, ASBMR has made increasing public and healthcare professional awareness of bone diseases a top priority. The Society launched several educational initiatives aimed at primary care physicians to improve the detection and treatment of bone diseases, and founded the National Bone Health Alliance to serve as a resource and raise public awareness of bone diseases. It has also spearheaded task forces on numerous clinically relevant topics, including: osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures. The Society has also sought to expand the study of bone to those in related fields and to those in emerging areas of the world. ASBMR's annual meeting brings together leading basic, translational and clinical researchers in bone from around the world. The event is held in September or October and attracts nearly 4,000 attendees each year. The scientific program includes poster presentations, plenary lectures, workshops, networking events, ancillary meetings, and a host of other activities. Hallmarks of the ASBMR Annual Meeting include the Gerald D. Aurbach Lecture, the Louis V. Avioli Lecture, and the ASBMR/ECTS Clinical Debate. Abstracts from the meeting's poster presentations are published as supplements in the JBMR. The ASBMR began holding topical meetings in 2002 to address specialized research topics within the bone field. Smaller in scale, topical meetings disseminate and discuss in-depth research on a specific area of scientific interest. The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, the official journal of the ASBMR. The JBMR publishes original manuscripts, reviews, and special articles in basic and clinical science relevant to bone, muscle and mineral metabolism. Manuscripts are published on the biology and physiology of bone and muscle, relevant systems biology topics (e.g. osteoimmunology), and the pathophysiology and treatment of osteoporosis, sarcopenia and other disorders of bone and mineral metabolism. 2016 Journal Citation Reports Impact Factor was 6.3, ranking 15/138 (Endocrinology & Metabolism). JBMR readers include basic scientists and physicians specializing in endocrinology, physiology, cell biology, pathology, molecular genetics, epidemiology, internal medicine, rheumatology, orthopaedics, geriatrics, dentistry, gynecology, molecular biology, nephrology and many other disciplines. The JBMR's international editorial board encourages manuscript submissions from around the world. The Primer on the Metabolic Bone Diseases and Disorders of Mineral Metabolism is a resource for scientists and students seeking an overview of the bone and mineral field and for clinicians who see patients with disorders of bone and mineral metabolism. The text provides valuable information on the symptoms, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of metabolic bone diseases and both common and rare disorders. Authors include internationally renowned experts in the field\n",

Furthermore, if the observer is elevated, the horizon zenith angle can be greater than 90°. Atmospheric models that derive from hydrostatic considerations assume an atmosphere of constant composition and a single mechanism of extinction, which isn't quite correct. There are three main sources of attenuation (Hayes & Latham 1975): Rayleigh scattering by air molecules, Mie scattering by aerosols, and molecular absorption (primarily by ozone). The relative contribution of each source varies with elevation above sea level, and the concentrations of aerosols and ozone cannot be derived simply from hydrostatic considerations. Rigorously, when the extinction coefficient depends on elevation, it must be determined as part of the air mass integral, as described by Thomason, Herman & Reagan (1983). A compromise approach often is possible, however. Methods for separately calculating the extinction from each species using closed-form expressions are described in Schaefer (1993) and Schaefer (1998). The latter reference includes source code for a BASIC program to perform the calculations. Reasonably accurate calculation of extinction can sometimes be done by using one of the simple air mass formulas and separately determining extinction coefficients for each of the attenuating species (Green 1992, Pickering 2002). In optical astronomy, the air mass provides an indication of the deterioration of the observed image, not only as regards direct effects of spectral absorption, scattering and reduced brightness, but also an aggregation of visual aberrations, e.g. resulting from atmospheric turbulence, collectively referred to as the quality of the \"seeing\". On bigger telescopes, such as the WHT (Wynne & Worswick 1988) and VLT (Avila, Rupprecht & Beckers 1997), the atmospheric dispersion can be so severe that it affects the pointing of the telescope to the target. In such cases an atmospheric dispersion compensator is used, which usually consists of two prisms. The Greenwood frequency and Fried parameter, both relevant for adaptive optics, depend on the air mass above them (or more specifically, on the zenith angle). In radio astronomy the air mass (which influences the optical path length) is not relevant. The lower layers of the atmosphere, modeled by the air mass, do not significantly impede radio waves, which are of much lower frequency than optical waves. Instead, some radio waves are affected by the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere. Newer aperture synthesis radio telescopes are especially affected by this as they “see” a much larger portion of the sky and thus the ionosphere. In fact, LOFAR needs to explicitly calibrate for these distorting effects (van der Tol & van der Veen 2007; de Vos, Gunst & Nijboer 2009), but on the other hand can also study the ionosphere by instead measuring these distortions (Thidé 2007). In some fields, such as solar energy and photovoltaics, air mass is indicated by the acronym AM; additionally, the value of the air mass is often given by appending its value to AM, so that AM1 indicates an air mass of 1, AM2 indicates an air mass of 2, and so on. The region above Earth's atmosphere, where there is no atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation, is considered to have \"air mass zero\" (AM0). Atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation is not the same for all wavelengths; consequently, passage through the atmosphere not only reduces intensity but also alters the spectral irradiance. Photovoltaic modules are commonly rated using spectral irradiance for an air mass of 1.5 (AM1.5); tables of these standard spectra are given in ASTM G 173-03. The extraterrestrial spectral irradiance (i.e., that for AM0) is given in ASTM E 490-00a. For many solar energy applications when high accuracy near the horizon is not required, air mass is commonly determined using the simple secant formula described in § Plane-parallel atmosphere\n",

      "#Air mass (astronomy)\n",
      "In astronomy, air mass or airmass is a measure of the amount of air along the line of sight when observing a star or other celestial source from below Earth's atmosphere (Green 1992). It is formulated as the integral of air density along the light ray. As it penetrates the atmosphere, light is attenuated by scattering and absorption; the thicker atmosphere through which it passes, the greater the attenuation. Consequently, celestial bodies when nearer the horizon appear less bright than when nearer the zenith. This attenuation, known as atmospheric extinction, is described quantitatively by the Beer–Lambert law. \"Air mass\" normally indicates relative air mass, the ratio of absolute air masses (as defined above) at oblique incidence relative to that at zenith.\n",

      " .., I . In the simplest case, an asymptotic distribution exists if the probability distribution of Zi converges to a probability distribution (the asymptotic distribution) as i increases: see convergence in distribution. A special case of an asymptotic distribution is when the sequence of random variables is always zero or Zi = 0 as i approaches infinity. Here the asymptotic distribution is a degenerate distribution, corresponding to the value zero. However, the most usual sense in which the term asymptotic distribution is used arises where the random variables Zi are modified by two sequences of non-random values. Thus if Y i = Z i − a i b i {\\displaystyle Y_{i}={\\frac {Z_{i}-a_{i}}{b_{i}}}} converges in distribution to a non-degenerate distribution for two sequences {ai} and {bi} then Zi is said to have that distribution as its asymptotic distribution. If the distribution function of the asymptotic distribution is F then, for large n, the following approximations hold P ( Z n − a n b n ≤ x ) ≈ F ( x ) , {\\displaystyle P\\left({\\frac {Z_{n}-a_{n}}{b_{n}}}\\leq x\\right)\\approx F(x),} P ( Z n ≤ z ) ≈ F ( z − a n b n ) . {\\displaystyle P(Z_{n}\\leq z)\\approx F\\left({\\frac {z-a_{n}}{b_{n}}}\\right).} If an asymptotic distribution exists, it is not necessarily true that any one outcome of the sequence of random variables is a convergent sequence of numbers. It is the sequence of probability distributions that converges. Perhaps the most common distribution to arise as an asymptotic distribution is the normal distribution. In particular, the central limit theorem provides an example where the asymptotic distribution is the normal distribution. Central limit theorem Suppose { X 1 , X 2 , … } {\\displaystyle \\{X_{1},X_{2},\\dots \\}} is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with E [ X i ] = μ {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {E} [X_{i}]=\\mu } and Var ⁡ [ X i ] = σ 2 < ∞ {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Var} [X_{i}]=\\sigma ^{2}<\\infty } .

Then as n {\\displaystyle n} approaches infinity, the random variables n ( S n − μ ) {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {n}}(S_{n}-\\mu )} converge in distribution to a normal N ( 0 , σ 2 ) {\\displaystyle N(0,\\sigma ^{2})} : The central limit theorem gives only an asymptotic distribution. As an approximation for a finite number of observations, it provides a reasonable approximation only when close to the peak of the normal distribution; it requires a very large number of observations to stretch into the tails. Local asymptotic normality is a generalization of the central limit theorem. It is a property of a sequence of statistical models, which allows this sequence to be asymptotically approximated by a normal location model, after a rescaling of the parameter. An important example when the local asymptotic normality holds is in the case of independent and identically distributed sampling from a regular parametric model; this is just the central limit theorem.

      "In mathematics and statistics, an asymptotic distribution is a probability distribution that is in a sense the \"limiting\" distribution of a sequence of distributions. One of the main uses of the idea of an asymptotic distribution is in providing approximations to the cumulative distribution functions of statistical estimators. A sequence of distributions corresponds to a sequence of random variables Zi for i = 1, 2, ..., I . In the simplest case, an asymptotic distribution exists if the probability distribution of Zi converges to a probability distribution (the asymptotic distribution) as i increases: see convergence in distribution. A special case of an asymptotic distribution is when the sequence of random variables is always zero or Zi = 0 as i approaches infinity.\n",

      "  The mechanism dune furrows are formed are through cryo jets and many form at alluvial fans. Furrows are channels and although mostly small they can vary in size and everytime they form in the spring season. Furrows do not have a long lifetime as they are often blown away by strong summer winds. In comparison, the South Pole differs in having higher elevation which can cause changes in alcove formation. These differences include the South Pole having older alcoves due to its denser deposition craters which are approximately 2 to 3 m thick which include particles of ice and minerals, and craters that contains carbon dioxide ice. Both South Pole and North Pole alcoves are formed through stress cementing the sandstone particles together. So after erosion, at the area where the most rock has been excavated by weathering the pressure builds up and the sand particles become very stable and hold the arch above. Annually in the North Pole region, alcove formation is most active during autumn and winter seasons and also form specific alcove-apron regions during springtime sublimation. This is when the alcoves start at the edge of dunes and deposit and end into an apron fan shape. During summertime on Mars, strong winds will blow away smaller less stable alcoves which starts the cycle for new alcoves to form the following autumn and winter. It is estimated that alcove formation is responsible for a range of 2 to 20% of sand movement on Mars.

Complete the proof by pointing out that the upper and lower bounds are shown previously to approach H as k → ∞. The assumptions of stationarity/ergodicity/identical distribution of random variables is not essential for the asymptotic equipartition property to hold. Indeed, as is quite clear intuitively, the asymptotic equipartition property requires only some form of the law of large numbers to hold, which is fairly general. However, the expression needs to be suitably generalized, and the conditions need to be formulated precisely. We assume that the source is producing independent symbols, with possibly different output statistics at each instant. We assume that the statistics of the process are known completely, that is, the marginal distribution of the process seen at each time instant is known. The joint distribution is just the product of marginals. Then, under the condition (which can be relaxed) that V a r [ log ⁡ p ( X i ) ] < M {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {Var} [\\log p(X_{i})]<M} for all i, for some M > 0, the following holds (AEP): lim n → ∞ Pr [ | − 1 n log ⁡ p ( X 1 , X 2 , … , X n ) − H ¯ n ( X ) | < ε ] = 1 ∀ ε > 0 {\\displaystyle \\lim _{n\\to \\infty }\\Pr \\left[\\,\\left|-{\\frac {1}{n}}\\log p(X_{1},X_{2},\\ldots ,X_{n})-{\\overline {H}}_{n}(X)\\right|<\\varepsilon \\right]=1\\qquad \\forall \\varepsilon >0} where H ¯ n ( X ) = 1 n H ( X 1 , X 2 , … , X n ) {\\displaystyle {\\overline {H}}_{n}(X)={\\frac {1}{n}}H(X_{1},X_{2},\\ldots ,X_{n})} Proof The proof follows from a simple application of Markov's inequality (applied to second moment of log ⁡ ( p ( X i ) ) {\\displaystyle \\log(p(X_{i}))} . Pr [ | − 1 n log ⁡ p ( X 1 , X 2 , … , X n ) − H ¯ ( X ) | > ε ] ≤ 1 n 2 ε 2 V a r [ ∑ i = 1 n ( log ⁡ ( p ( X i ) ) 2 ] ≤ M n ε 2 → 0  as  n → ∞ {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\Pr \\left[\\left|-{\\frac {1}{n}}\\log p(X_{1},X_{2},\\ldots ,X_{n})-{\\overline {H}}(X)\\right|>\\varepsilon \\right]&\\leq {\\frac {1}{n^{2}\\varepsilon ^{2}}}\\mathrm {Var} \\left[\\sum _{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\log(p(X_{i})\\right)^{2}\\right]\\\\&\\leq {\\frac {M}{n\\varepsilon ^{2}}}\\to 0{\\text{ as }}n\\to \\infty \\end{aligned}}} It is obvious that the proof holds if any moment E [ | log ⁡ p ( X i ) | r ] {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {E} \\left[|\\log p(X_{i})|^{r}\\right]} is uniformly bounded for r > 1 (again by Markov's inequality applied to r-th moment). Q.E.D. Even this condition is not necessary, but given a non-stationary random process, it should not be difficult to test whether the asymptotic equipartition property holds using the above method. The asymptotic equipartition property for non-stationary discrete-time independent process leads us to (among other results) the source coding theorem for non-stationary source (with independent output symbols) and noisy-channel coding theorem for non-stationary memoryless channels. Discrete-time functions can be interpolated to continuous-time functions. If such interpolation f is measurable, we may define the continuous-time stationary process accordingly as X ~ := f ∘ X {\\displaystyle {\\tilde {X}}:=f\\circ X} . If the asymptotic equipartition property holds for the discrete-time process, as in the i.i.d. or finite-valued stationary ergodic cases shown above, it automatically holds for the continuous-time stationary process derived from it by some measurable interpolation. i.e. − 1 n log ⁡ p ( X ~ 0 τ ) → H ( X ) {\\displaystyle -{\\frac {1}{n}}\\log p({\\tilde {X}}_{0}^{\\tau })\\to H(X)} where n corresponds to the degree of freedom in time τ. nH(X)/τ and H(X) are the entropy per unit time and per degree of freedom respectively, defined by Shannon. An important class of such continuous-time stationary process is the bandlimited stationary ergodic process with the sample space being a subset of the continuous L 2 {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}_{2}} functions. The asymptotic equipartition property holds if the process is white, in which case the time samples are i.i.d., or there exists T > 1/2W, where W is the nominal bandwidth, such that the T-spaced time samples take values in a finite set, in which case we have the discrete-time finite-valued stationary ergodic process. Any time-invariant operations also preserves the asymptotic equipartition property, stationarity and ergodicity and we may easily turn a stationary process to non-stationary without losing the asymptotic equipartition property by nulling out a finite number of time samples in the process\n",

      "  Yonath focuses on the mechanisms underlying protein biosynthesis, by ribosomal crystallography, a research line she pioneered over twenty years ago despite considerable skepticism of the international scientific community. Ribosomes translate RNA into protein and because they have slightly different structures in microbes, when compared to eukaryotes, such as human cells, they are often a target for antibiotics. In 2000 and 2001, she determined the complete high-resolution structures of both ribosomal subunits and discovered within the otherwise asymmetric ribosome, the universal symmetrical region that provides the framework and navigates the process of polypeptide polymerization. Consequently, she showed that the ribosome is a ribozyme that places its substrates in stereochemistry suitable for peptide bond formation and for substrate-mediated catalysis. In 1993 she visualized the path taken by the nascent proteins, namely the ribosomal tunnel, and recently revealed the dynamics elements enabling its involvement in elongation arrest, gating, intra-cellular regulation and nascent chain trafficking into their folding space. Additionally, Yonath elucidated the modes of action of over twenty different antibiotics targeting the ribosome, illuminated mechanisms of drug resistance and synergism, deciphered the structural basis for antibiotic selectivity and showed how it plays a key role in clinical usefulness and therapeutic effectiveness, thus paving the way for structure-based drug design. For enabling ribosomal crystallography Yonath introduced a novel technique, cryo bio-crystallography, which became routine in structural biology and allowed intricate projects otherwise considered formidable. At the Weizmann Institute, Yonath is the incumbent of the Martin S. and Helen Kimmel Professorial Chair. She has called for the unconditional release of all Hamas prisoners, saying that \"holding Palestinians captive encourages and perpetuates their motivation to harm Israel and its citizens ... once we don't have any prisoners to release they will have no reason to kidnap soldiers\".

      " Abraham Robinson (born Robinsohn; October 6, 1918 – April 11, 1974) was a mathematician who is most widely known for development of nonstandard analysis, a mathematically rigorous system whereby infinitesimal and infinite numbers were reincorporated into modern mathematics. Nearly half of Robinson's papers were in applied mathematics rather than in pure mathematics. He was born to a Jewish family with strong Zionist beliefs, in Waldenburg, Germany, which is now Wałbrzych, in Poland. In 1933, he emigrated to British Mandate of Palestine, where he earned a first degree from the Hebrew University. Robinson was in France when the Nazis invaded during World War II, and escaped by train and on foot, being alternately questioned by French soldiers suspicious of his German passport and asked by them to share his map, which was more detailed than theirs. While in London, he joined the Free French Air Force and contributed to the war effort by teaching himself aerodynamics and becoming an expert on the airfoils used in the wings of fighter planes. After the war, Robinson worked in London, Toronto, and Jerusalem, but ended up at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1962. He became known for his approach of using the methods of mathematical logic to attack problems in analysis and abstract algebra. He \"introduced many of the fundamental notions of model theory\". Using these methods, he found a way of using formal logic to show that there are self-consistent nonstandard models of the real number system that include infinite and infinitesimal numbers. Others, such as Wilhelmus Luxemburg, showed that the same results could be achieved using ultrafilters, which made Robinson's work more accessible to mathematicians who lacked training in formal logic. Robinson's book Non-standard Analysis was published in 1966. Robinson was strongly interested in the history and philosophy of mathematics, and often remarked that he wanted to get inside the head of Leibniz, the first mathematician to attempt to articulate clearly the concept of infinitesimal numbers. While at UCLA his colleagues remember him as working hard to accommodate PhD students of all levels of ability by finding them projects of the appropriate difficulty. He was courted by Yale, and after some initial reluctance, he moved there in 1967. In the Spring of 1973 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. He died of pancreatic cancer in 1974.

      "Abraham Robinson (born Robinsohn; October 6, 1918 – April 11, 1974) was a mathematician who is most widely known for development of nonstandard analysis, a mathematically rigorous system whereby infinitesimal and infinite numbers were reincorporated into modern mathematics. Nearly half of Robinson's papers were in applied mathematics rather than in pure mathematics. He was born to a Jewish family with strong Zionist beliefs, in Waldenburg, Germany, which is now Wałbrzych, in Poland. In 1933, he emigrated to British Mandate of Palestine, where he earned a first degree from the Hebrew University. Robinson was in France when the Nazis invaded during World War II, and escaped by train and on foot, being alternately questioned by French soldiers suspicious of his German passport and asked by them to share his map, which was more detailed than theirs.\n",

      "ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) is a technique used in molecular biology to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility. In 2013, the technique was first described as an alternative advanced method for MNase-seq, FAIRE-Seq and DNase-Seq. ATAC-seq is a faster and more sensitive analysis of the epigenome than DNase-seq or MNase-seq. ATAC-seq identifies accessible DNA regions by probing open chromatin with hyperactive mutant Tn5 Transposase that inserts sequencing adapters into open regions of the genome. While naturally occurring transposases have a low level of activity, ATAC-seq employs the mutated hyperactive transposase. In a process called \"tagmentation\", Tn5 transposase cleaves and tags double-stranded DNA with sequencing adaptors. The tagged DNA fragments are then purified, PCR-amplified, and sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Sequencing reads can then be used to infer regions of increased accessibility as well as to map regions of transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome positions.\n",

      "  Accumulation of misfolded proteins in proteinaceous inclusions is common to many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In cultured cells, when the production of misfolded proteins exceeds the capacity of the chaperone refolding system and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, misfolded proteins are actively transported to a cytoplasmic juxtanuclear structure called an aggresome. Whether aggresomes are benevolent or noxious is unknown, but they are of particular interest because of the appearance of similar inclusions in protein deposition diseases. Evidence shows that aggresomes serve a cytoprotective function and are associated with accelerated turnover of mutant proteins. Experiments show that mutant androgen receptor (AR), the protein responsible for X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy, forms insoluble aggregates and is toxic to cultured cells. Mutant AR was also found to form aggresomes in a process distinct from aggregation. Molecular and pharmacological interventions were used to disrupt aggresome formation, revealing their cytoprotective function. Aggresome-forming proteins were found to have an accelerated rate of turnover, and this turnover was slowed by inhibition of aggresome formation. Finally, it is shown that aggresome-forming proteins become membrane-bound and associate with lysosomal structures. Together, these findings suggest that aggresomes are cytoprotective, serving as cytoplasmic recruitment centers to facilitate degradation of toxic proteins. Histone deacetylase 6 is the protein that, in the deacetylase adaptor protein function, forms Lewy bodies (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). No mutation associated with disease has been linked to this protein. Parkin is the protein that, in the protein ligase function, forms Lewy bodies (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). Parkinson's disease has been linked to this protein when there is a protein. Ataxin-3 is the protein that, in the deubiquitinating enzyme function, forms SCA type-1 and 2 DRPLA intranuclear inclusions (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). SCA type-3 has been linked to this protein when there is a protein. Dynein motor complex is the protein that, in the retrograde microtubule motor function, forms an unknown protein (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). Motor neuron degeneration has been linked to this protein when there is a protein. Ubiquilin-1 is the protein that, in the protein turnover, intracellular trafficking function, forms Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles (the regular wild-type protein localized to inclusion bodies). Alzheimer's disease (potential risk factor) has been linked to this protein when there is a protein. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an inefficiently folded integral membrane protein that is degraded by the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Overexpression or inhibition of proteasome activity in transfected human embryonic kidney cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to the accumulation of stable, high molecular weight, detergent-insoluble, multi-ubiquitinated forms of CFTR. Undergraded CFTR molecules accumulate at a distinct pericentriolar aggresome. There is emerging evidence that inhibiting the aggresome pathway leads to accumulation of misfolded proteins and apoptosis in tumor cells through autophagy.

      "  The station was opened as Acton on 1 August 1853[page needed] by the North and South Western Junction Railway (N&SWJR), but was renamed Acton Central on 1 November 1925. The N&SWJR was leased jointly to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), the Midland Railway (MR) and the North London Railway (NLR) from 1871, but only the NLR operated passenger trains on the N&SWJR until operation of the NLR (and thus of the N&SWJR also) was taken over by the LNWR in 1909. Under the terms of the Railways Act 1921, the LNWR and MR amalgamated (together with some others) at the start of 1923 to form the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, which then absorbed both the NLR and the N&SWJR. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Network SouthEast until the privatisation of British Railways. Between 1875 and 1902 it was connected with St Pancras via the Dudding Hill line, which branches off the North London line between Acton Central and Willesden Junction. Harlesden (Midland) railway station was the next stop on the line north. The Dudding Hill line is still open today, but only carries freight. Acton Central station was named for closure by the 1963 Beeching Report, also known as the Beeching Axe. Acton Central was in Zone 2 until 2 January 2008. In 2011, the platforms were lengthened to allow longer trains. Acton Central currently has the following London Overground (North London Line) services, which are operated by Class 378 trainsets: Off-peak: 4tph (trains per hour) to Stratford via Willesden Junction and Camden Road 4tph to Richmond London Buses routes 70, 207 and 218 and SL8, and night routes N7, N207 and N266 serve the station. \"London and South East\" (PDF).

      "In optical astronomy, interferometry is used to combine signals from two or more telescopes to obtain measurements with higher resolution than could be obtained with either telescopes individually. This technique is the basis for astronomical interferometer arrays, which can make measurements of very small astronomical objects if the telescopes are spread out over a wide area. If a large number of telescopes are used a picture can be produced which has resolution similar to a single telescope with the diameter of the combined spread of telescopes. These include radio telescope arrays such as VLA, VLBI, SMA, LOFAR and SKA, and more recently[when?] astronomical optical interferometer arrays such as COAST, NPOI and IOTA, resulting in the highest resolution optical images ever achieved in astronomy.\n",

      "B: The change in frequency of light is inversely proportional to the work done on the wall by radiation pressure.\n",

      "answer: None\n",
      "\n",
      "original_text:\n",
      "  Because the light is reflected, the pressure is equal to twice the momentum carried by light, which is E/c. The rate at which the pressure does work on the wall is found by multiplying by the velocity: Δ E = v 2 E c . {\\displaystyle \\Delta E=v{\\frac {2E}{c}}.} This means that the change in frequency of the light is equal to the work done on the wall by the radiation pressure. The light that is reflected is changed both in frequency and in energy by the same amount: Δ f f = Δ E E . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\Delta f}{f}}={\\frac {\\Delta E}{E}}.} Since moving the wall slowly should keep a thermal distribution fixed, the probability that the light has energy E at frequency f must only be a function of E/f. This function cannot be determined from thermodynamic reasoning alone, and Wien guessed at the form that was valid at high frequency. He supposed that the average energy in high-frequency modes was suppressed by a Boltzmann-like factor: ⟨ E f ⟩ = e − β h f . {\\displaystyle \\langle E_{f}\\rangle =e^{-\\beta hf}.} This is not the expected classical energy in the mode, which is 1 / 2 β {\\displaystyle 1/2\\beta } by equipartition, but a new and unjustified assumption that fit the high-frequency data. When the expectation value is added over all modes in a cavity, this is Wien's distribution, and it describes the thermodynamic distribution of energy in a classical gas of photons. Wien's law implicitly assumes that light is statistically composed of packets that change energy and frequency in the same way. The entropy of a Wien gas scales as the volume to the power N, where N is the number of packets. This led Einstein to suggest that light is composed of localizable particles with energy proportional to the frequency. Then the entropy of the Wien gas can be given a statistical interpretation as the number of possible positions that the photons can be in. Suppose that a Hamiltonian is slowly time-varying, for example, a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with a changing frequency: H t ( p , x ) = p 2 2 m + m ω ( t ) 2 x 2 2 . {\\displaystyle H_{t}(p,x)={\\frac {p^{2}}{2m}}+{\\frac {m\\omega (t)^{2}x^{2}}{2}}.} The action J of a classical orbit is the area enclosed by the orbit in phase space: J = ∫ 0 T p ( t ) d x d t d t . {\\displaystyle J=\\int _{0}^{T}p(t)\\,{\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\,dt.} Since J is an integral over a full period, it is only a function of the energy. When the Hamiltonian is constant in time, and J is constant in time, the canonically conjugate variable θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } increases in time at a steady rate: d θ d t = ∂ H ∂ J = H ′ ( J ) . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d\\theta }{dt}}={\\frac {\\partial H}{\\partial J}}=H'(J).} So the constant H ′ {\\displaystyle H'} can be used to change time derivatives along the orbit to partial derivatives with respect to θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } at constant J. Differentiating the integral for J with respect to J gives an identity that fixes H ′ {\\displaystyle H'} : d J d J = 1 = ∫ 0 T ( ∂ p ∂ J d x d t + p ∂ ∂ J d x d t ) d t = H ′ ∫ 0 T ( ∂ p ∂ J ∂ x ∂ θ − ∂ p ∂ θ ∂ x ∂ J ) d t . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dJ}{dJ}}=1=\\int _{0}^{T}\\left({\\frac {\\partial p}{\\partial J}}{\\frac {dx}{dt}}+p{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial J}}{\\frac {dx}{dt}}\\right)\\,dt=H'\\int _{0}^{T}\\left({\\frac {\\partial p}{\\partial J}}{\\frac {\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta }}-{\\frac {\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta }}{\\frac {\\partial x}{\\partial J}}\\right)\\,dt.} The integrand is the Poisson bracket of x and p. The Poisson bracket of two canonically conjugate quantities, like x and p, is equal to 1 in any canonical coordinate system. So 1 = H ′ ∫ 0 T { x , p } d t = H ′ T , {\\displaystyle 1=H'\\int _{0}^{T}\\{x,p\\}\\,dt=H'T,} and H ′ {\\displaystyle H'} is the inverse period. The variable θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } increases by an equal amount in each period for all values of J – it is an angle variable. The Hamiltonian is a function of J only, and in the simple case of the harmonic oscillator, H = ω J . {\\displaystyle H=\\omega J.} When H has no time dependence, J is constant. When H is slowly time-varying, the rate of change of J can be computed by re-expressing the integral for J: J = ∫ 0 2 π p ∂ x ∂ θ d θ . {\\displaystyle J=\\int _{0}^{2\\pi }p{\\frac {\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta }}\\,d\\theta .} The time derivative of this quantity is d J d t = ∫ 0 2 π ( d p d t ∂ x ∂ θ + p d d t ∂ x ∂ θ ) d θ . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dJ}{dt}}=\\int _{0}^{2\\pi }\\left({\\frac {dp}{dt}}{\\frac {\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta }}+p{\\frac {d}{dt}}{\\frac {\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta }}\\right)\\,d\\theta .} Replacing time derivatives with theta derivatives, using d θ = ω d t , {\\displaystyle d\\theta =\\omega \\,dt,} and setting ω := 1 {\\displaystyle \\omega :=1} without loss of generality ( ω {\\displaystyle \\omega } being a global multiplicative constant in the resulting time derivative of the action) yields d J d t = ∫ 0 2 π ( ∂ p ∂ θ ∂ x ∂ θ + p ∂ ∂ θ ∂ x ∂ θ ) d θ . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dJ}{dt}}=\\int _{0}^{2\\pi }\\left({\\frac {\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta }}{\\frac {\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta }}+p{\\frac {\\partial }{\\partial \\theta }}{\\frac {\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta }}\\right)\\,d\\theta .} So as long as the coordinates J, θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } do not change appreciably over one period, this expression can be integrated by parts to give zero\n",

      " Assay offices are institutions set up to assay (test the purity of) precious metals. This is often done to protect consumers from buying fake items. Upon successful completion of an assay (i.e. if the metallurgical content is found be equal or better than that claimed by the maker and it otherwise conforms to the prevailing law) the assay offices typically stamp a hallmark on the item to certify its metallurgical content. Hallmarking first appeared in France, with the Goldsmiths' Statute of 1260 promulgated under Étienne Boileau, Provost of Paris, for King Louis IX. Title 15, Chapter 8, Section 291 of the United States Code makes it unlawful to stamp goods in the United States with \"United States assay\" or any similar stamp which gives the impression that the item has been officially assayed by the United States government. Assay offices did and do exist in the U.S., but they are affiliated with the government's coinage mints and serve only the government's purposes in that field. They are not involved in hallmarking, as there has never been a hallmarking scheme in the U.S. In the 1800s, the functions of assay offices in the U.S. included receiving bullion deposits from the public and from mining prospectors in the various American territories. The assay offices that still operate today function solely within national coining system (including bullion coinage for sales to investors). Current U.S. assay offices include the following: The Philadelphia Mint – 1792 to date The Denver Mint – 1862 to date. It served as an assay office until 1906, when coinage operations began. The San Francisco Mint – 1852 to date. Coinage operations were suspended in March 1955, but the plant continued to operate as an assay office. In 1962, its official designation was changed from mint to assay office. Coinage operations were again authorized in 1965. The West Point, New York Bullion Depository – 1938 to date. It is operated as an adjunct of the New York Assay Office. The Charlotte, North Carolina Mint – 1835 to 1861. After the Civil War, the plant was reopened in 1868 as an assay office until 1913, when it was ultimately closed. The New Orleans, Louisiana Mint – 1835 to 1942.

Upon successful completion of an assay (i.e. if the metallurgical content is found be equal or better than that claimed by the maker and it otherwise conforms to the prevailing law) the assay offices typically stamp a hallmark on the item to certify its metallurgical content. Hallmarking first appeared in France, with the Goldsmiths' Statute of 1260 promulgated under Étienne Boileau, Provost of Paris, for King Louis IX. Title 15, Chapter 8, Section 291 of the United States Code makes it unlawful to stamp goods in the United States with \"United States assay\" or any similar stamp which gives the impression that the item has been officially assayed by the United States government.\n",

      "  Similarly, the R {\\displaystyle R} particles are resampled to M {\\displaystyle M} particles with the weight π j {\\displaystyle \\pi _{j}} . The original particle filters draw samples from the prior density, while the auxiliary filters draw from the joint distribution of the prior density and the likelihood. In other words, the auxiliary particle filters avoid the circumstance which the particles are generated in the regions with low likelihood. As a result, the samples can approximate f ( α t + 1 | Y t + 1 ) {\\displaystyle f(\\alpha _{t+1}|Y_{t+1})} more precisely. The selection of the auxiliary variable affects g ( α t + 1 , k | Y t + 1 ) {\\displaystyle g(\\alpha _{t+1},k|Y_{t+1})} and controls the distribution of the samples. A possible selection of g ( α t + 1 , k | Y t + 1 ) {\\displaystyle g(\\alpha _{t+1},k|Y_{t+1})} can be: g ( α t + 1 , k | Y t + 1 ) ∝ f ( y t + 1 | μ t + 1 k ) f ( α t + 1 | α t k ) π k {\\displaystyle g(\\alpha _{t+1},k|Y_{t+1})\\propto f(y_{t+1}|\\mu _{t+1}^{k})f(\\alpha _{t+1}|\\alpha _{t}^{k})\\pi ^{k}} , where k = 1 , . . . , M {\\displaystyle k=1,...,M} and μ t + 1 k {\\displaystyle \\mu _{t+1}^{k}} is the mean. We sample from g ( α t + 1 , k | Y t + 1 ) {\\displaystyle g(\\alpha _{t+1},k|Y_{t+1})} to approximate f ( α t + 1 | Y t + 1 ) {\\displaystyle f(\\alpha _{t+1}|Y_{t+1})} by the following procedure: First, we assign probabilities to the indexes of f ( α t + 1 | α t k ) {\\displaystyle f(\\alpha _{t+1}|\\alpha _{t}^{k})} . We named these probabilities as the first-stage weights λ k {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{k}} , which are proportional to g ( k | Y t + 1 ) ∝ π k f ( y t + 1 | μ t + 1 k ) {\\displaystyle g(k|Y_{t+1})\\propto \\pi ^{k}f(y_{t+1}|\\mu _{t+1}^{k})} . Then, we draw R {\\displaystyle R} samples from f ( α t + 1 | α t k ) {\\displaystyle f(\\alpha _{t+1}|\\alpha _{t}^{k})} with the weighted indexes. By doing so, we are actually drawing the samples from g ( α t + 1 , k | Y t + 1 ) {\\displaystyle g(\\alpha _{t+1},k|Y_{t+1})} . Moreover, we reassign the second-stage weights π j = ω j ∑ i = 1 R ω i {\\displaystyle \\pi _{j}={\\frac {\\omega _{j}}{\\sum _{i=1}^{R}\\omega _{i}}}} as the probabilities of the R {\\displaystyle R} samples, where ω j = f ( y t + 1 | α t + 1 j ) f ( y t + 1 | μ t + 1 j ) {\\displaystyle \\omega _{j}={\\frac {f(y_{t+1}|\\alpha _{t+1}^{j})}{f(y_{t+1}|\\mu _{t+1}^{j})}}} . The weights are aim to compensate the effect of μ t + 1 k {\\displaystyle \\mu _{t+1}^{k}} . Finally, the R {\\displaystyle R} particles are resampled to M {\\displaystyle M} particles with the weights π j {\\displaystyle \\pi _{j}} . Following the procedure, we draw the R {\\displaystyle R} samples from g ( α t + 1 , k | Y t + 1 ) {\\displaystyle g(\\alpha _{t+1},k|Y_{t+1})} . Since g ( α t + 1 , k | Y t + 1 ) {\\displaystyle g(\\alpha _{t+1},k|Y_{t+1})} is closely related to the mean μ t + 1 k {\\displaystyle \\mu _{t+1}^{k}} , it has high conditional likelihood. As a result, the sampling procedure is more efficient and the value R {\\displaystyle R} can be reduced. Assume that the filtered posterior is described by the following M weighted samples: p ( x t | z 1 : t ) ≈ ∑ i = 1 M ω t ( i ) δ ( x t − x t ( i ) ) . {\\displaystyle p(x_{t}|z_{1:t})\\approx \\sum _{i=1}^{M}\\omega _{t}^{(i)}\\delta \\left(x_{t}-x_{t}^{(i)}\\right).} Then, each step in the algorithm consists of first drawing a sample of the particle index k {\\displaystyle k} which will be propagated from t − 1 {\\displaystyle t-1} into the new step t {\\displaystyle t} . These indexes are auxiliary variables only used as an intermediary step, hence the name of the algorithm. The indexes are drawn according to the likelihood of some reference point μ t ( i ) {\\displaystyle \\mu _{t}^{(i)}} which in some way is related to the transition model x t | x t − 1 {\\displaystyle x_{t}|x_{t-1}} (for example, the mean, a sample, etc.): k ( i ) ∼ P ( i = k | z t ) ∝ ω t ( i ) p ( z t | μ t ( i ) ) {\\displaystyle k^{(i)}\\sim P(i=k|z_{t})\\propto \\omega _{t}^{(i)}p(z_{t}|\\mu _{t}^{(i)})} This is repeated for i = 1 , 2 , … , M {\\displaystyle i=1,2,\\dots ,M} , and using these indexes we can now draw the conditional samples: x t ( i ) ∼ p ( x | x t − 1 k ( i ) ) . {\\displaystyle x_{t}^{(i)}\\sim p(x|x_{t-1}^{k^{(i)}}).} Finally, the weights are updated to account for the mismatch between the likelihood at the actual sample and the predicted point μ t k ( i ) {\\displaystyle \\mu _{t}^{k^{(i)}}} : ω t ( i ) ∝ p ( z t | x t ( i ) ) p ( z t | μ t k ( i ) ) . {\\displaystyle \\omega _{t}^{(i)}\\propto {\\frac {p(z_{t}|x_{t}^{(i)})}{p(z_{t}|\\mu _{t}^{k^{(i)}})}}.} Pitt, Michael K.; Shephard, Neil. \"Filtering Via Simulation: Auxiliary Particle Filters\" (PDF).

      "  The atomic electron tomography technique is performed in transmission electron microscopes capable of reaching sub-Angstrom resolution. A collection of 2D images taken at numerous different tilt angles is acquired from the sample in question, and then used to reconstruct a 3D image. After image acquisition, a significant amount of processing must be done to correct for issues such as drift, noise, and scan distortion. High quality analysis and processing using atomic electron tomography results in a 3D reconstruction of an amorphous material detailing the atomic positions of the different species that are present. Fluctuation electron microscopy is another transmission electron microscopy based technique that is sensitive to the medium range order of amorphous materials. Structural fluctuations arising from different forms of medium range order can be detected with this method. Fluctuation electron microscopy experiments can be done in conventional or scanning transmission electron microscope mode. Simulation and modeling techniques are often combined with experimental methods to characterize structures of amorphous materials. Commonly used computational techniques include density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and reverse Monte Carlo. Amorphous phases are important constituents of thin films. Thin films are solid layers of a few nanometres to tens of micrometres thickness that are deposited onto a substrate. So-called structure zone models were developed to describe the microstructure of thin films as a function of the homologous temperature (Th), which is the ratio of deposition temperature to melting temperature. According to these models, a necessary condition for the occurrence of amorphous phases is that (Th) has to be smaller than 0.3. The deposition temperature must be below 30% of the melting temperature.[citation needed] Regarding their applications, amorphous metallic layers played an important role in the discovery of superconductivity in amorphous metals made by Buckel and Hilsch. The superconductivity of amorphous metals, including amorphous metallic thin films, is now understood to be due to phonon-mediated Cooper pairing. The role of structural disorder can be rationalized based on the strong-coupling Eliashberg theory of superconductivity. Amorphous solids typically exhibit higher localization of heat carriers compared to crystalline, giving rise to low thermal conductivity. Products for thermal protection, such as thermal barrier coatings and insulation, rely on materials with ultralow thermal conductivity. Today, optical coatings made from TiO2, SiO2, Ta2O5 etc. (and combinations of these) in most cases consist of amorphous phases of these compounds. Much research is carried out into thin amorphous films as a gas separating membrane layer. The technologically most important thin amorphous film is probably represented by a few nm thin SiO2 layers serving as isolator above the conducting channel of a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Also, hydrogenated amorphous silicon (Si:H) is of technical significance for thin-film solar cells.[citation needed] In the pharmaceutical industry, some amorphous drugs have been shown to offer higher bioavailability than their crystalline counterparts as a result of the higher solubility of the amorphous phase. However, certain compounds can undergo precipitation in their amorphous form in vivo, and can then decrease mutual bioavailability if administered together. Amorphous materials in soil strongly influence bulk density, aggregate stability, plasticity, and water holding capacity of soils. The low bulk density and high void ratios are mostly due to glass shards and other porous minerals not becoming compacted. Andisol soils contain the highest amounts of amorphous materials. The occurrence of amorphous phases turned out to be a phenomenon of particular interest for the studying of thin-film growth. The growth of polycrystalline films is often used and preceded by an initial amorphous layer, the thickness of which may amount to only a few nm. The most investigated example is represented by the unoriented molecules of thin polycrystalline silicon films. Wedge-shaped polycrystals were identified by transmission electron microscopy to grow out of the amorphous phase only after the latter has exceeded a certain thickness, the precise value of which depends on deposition temperature, background pressure, and various other process parameters. The phenomenon has been interpreted in the framework of Ostwald's rule of stages that predicts the formation of phases to proceed with increasing condensation time towards increasing stability. See the structure of liquids and glasses for more information on non-crystalline material structure. For higher values, the surface diffusion of deposited atomic species would allow for the formation of crystallites with long-range atomic order. In the case of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon, the missing long-range order between silicon atoms is partly induced by the presence of hydrogen in the percent range. An initial amorphous layer was observed in many studies of thin polycrystalline silicon films. Experimental studies of the phenomenon require a clearly defined state of the substrate surface—and its contaminant density, etc\n",

      "  Anaximander (610–546 BC) held that the apeiron was the principle or main element composing all things. Clearly, the 'apeiron' was some sort of basic substance. Plato's notion of the apeiron is more abstract, having to do with indefinite variability. The main dialogues where Plato discusses the 'apeiron' are the late dialogues Parmenides and the Philebus. Aristotle sums up the views of his predecessors on infinity as follows: \"Only the Pythagoreans place the infinite among the objects of sense (they do not regard number as separable from these), and assert that what is outside the heaven is infinite. Plato, on the other hand, holds that there is no body outside (the Forms are not outside because they are nowhere), yet that the infinite is present not only in the objects of sense but in the Forms also.\" (Aristotle) The theme was brought forward by Aristotle's consideration of the apeiron—in the context of mathematics and physics (the study of nature): \"Infinity turns out to be the opposite of what people say it is. It is not 'that which has nothing beyond itself' that is infinite, but 'that which always has something beyond itself'.\" (Aristotle) Belief in the existence of the infinite comes mainly from five considerations: From the nature of time – for it is infinite. From the division of magnitudes – for the mathematicians also use the notion of the infinite. If coming to be and passing away do not give out, it is only because that from which things come to be is infinite. Because the limited always finds its limit in something, so that there must be no limit, if everything is always limited by something different from itself. Most of all, a reason which is peculiarly appropriate and presents the difficulty that is felt by everybody – not only number but also mathematical magnitudes and what is outside the heaven are supposed to be infinite because they never give out in our thought. (Aristotle) Aristotle postulated that an actual infinity was impossible, because if it were possible, then something would have attained infinite magnitude, and would be \"bigger than the heavens.\" However, he said, mathematics relating to infinity was not deprived of its applicability by this impossibility, because mathematicians did not need the infinite for their theorems, just a finite, arbitrarily large magnitude. Aristotle handled the topic of infinity in Physics and in Metaphysics. He distinguished between actual and potential infinity. Actual infinity is completed and definite, and consists of infinitely many elements. Potential infinity is never complete: elements can be always added, but never infinitely many. \"For generally the infinite has this mode of existence: one thing is always being taken after another, and each thing that is taken is always finite, but always different.\" — Aristotle, Physics, book 3, chapter 6. Aristotle distinguished between infinity with respect to addition and division. But Plato has two infinities, the Great and the Small. — Physics, book 3, chapter 4. \"As an example of a potentially infinite series in respect to increase, one number can always be added after another in the series that starts 1,2,3,... but the process of adding more and more numbers cannot be exhausted or completed.\"[citation needed] With respect to division, a potentially infinite sequence of divisions might start, for example, 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, but the process of division cannot be exhausted or completed. \"For the fact that the process of dividing never comes to an end ensures that this activity exists potentially, but not that the infinite exists separately.\" — Metaphysics, book 9, chapter 6. Aristotle also argued that Greek mathematicians knew the difference among the actual infinite and a potential one, but they \"do not need the [actual] infinite and do not use it\" (Phys. III 2079 29). The overwhelming majority of scholastic philosophers adhered to the motto Infinitum actu non datur. This means there is only a (developing, improper, \"syncategorematic\") potential infinity but not a (fixed, proper, \"categorematic\") actual infinity. There were exceptions, however, for example in England. It is well known that in the Middle Ages all scholastic philosophers advocate Aristotle's \"infinitum actu non datur\" as an irrefutable principle. (G. Cantor) Actual infinity exists in number, time and quantity. (J\n",

      "  Amanita nivalis is a small species of fungus which is usually white when young but which becomes tinged with grey or buff as it ages. It is rather variable in appearance over its wide range. The cap is dry, smooth and shiny and may be any size between 20 and 80 millimetres (0.8 and 3.1 in). It becomes slightly sticky when wet. It is hemi-spherical when young but flattens out with age and develops a slight umbo. Near the rim there are fine radiating striations and the surface of the cap may have a few pieces of the membranous volva adhering to it. The gills are pale cream, broad, fairly crowded and mostly unconnected to the stem. There are a few irregularly arranged shorter gills with truncated ends. The stem is 38 to 100 millimetres (1.5 to 3.9 in) long and 5 to 12 millimetres (0.2 to 0.5 in) wide, hollow and with a smooth surface. There may be a fragile ring but it soon falls off. The base of the stem grows out of a brittle, sac-like volva which is white or pale yellowish-brown. The spores are nearly spherical, being 10.0 to 13.5 µm by 8.8 to 12.0 µm. This species is said to have a nondescript odour and flavour. Amanita nivalis grows in subarctic and alpine conditions in Europe and also in Greenland. It is often associated with low growing willows (Salix spp.) and birches (Betula spp.). There have been reports of it occurring at high altitudes in the Rocky Mountains in North America. The fruit bodies appear singly or in small groups in both silicaceous and limestone areas in summer. The edibility of this species is not known but because of its rarity, it is best not to gather it. \"Synonymy: Amanita nivalis\". Species Fungorum. CAB International.

      "  A population related to this individual was the main source of the ancestry of later Anatolian Neolithic Farmers (also known as Early European Farmers), who along with Western Hunter Gatherers (WHG) and Ancient North Eurasians (via Eastern Hunter Gatherers and or Western Steppe Herders) are one of the three currently known ancestral genetic contributors to present-day Europeans. The existence of this ancient population has been inferred through the genetic analysis of the remains of a man from the site of Pınarbaşı (37 ° 29'N, 33 ° 02'E), in central Anatolia, which has been dated at 13,642-13,073 cal BCE. This population is genetically differentiated from the rest of the known Pleistocene populations. It has been discovered that populations of the Anatolian Neolithic (Anatolian Neolithic Farmers) derive most of their ancestry from the AHG, with minor gene flow from Iranian/Caucasus and Levantine sources, suggesting that agriculture was adopted in situ by these hunter-gatherers and not spread by demic diffusion into the region. The Anatolian hunter gatherers began farming around 8300 BC, at places such as Çayönü. Cows, sheep and goats may have been domesticated first in southern Turkey. These farmers moved into Thrace (now European Turkey) around 7000 BC. At the autosomal level, in the Principal component analysis (PCA) the analyzed AHG individual turns out to be close to two later Anatolian populations, the Anatolian Aceramic Farmers (AAF) dating from 8300-7800 BCE, and the Anatolian Ceramic Farmers (ACF) dating from 7000-6000 BCE. These early Anatolian farmers later replaced the European hunter-gatherer populations in Europe to a large extent, ultimately becoming the main genetic contribution to current European populations, especially those of the Mediterranean. In addition, their position in this analysis is intermediate between Natufian farmers and Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG). This last point is confirmed by the ADMIXTURE and qp-Adm analysis and confirms the presence of hunter-gatherers of both European and Near-Eastern origins in Central Anatolia in the late Pleistocene. Mesolithic individuals from the Balkans, known as Iron Gates Hunter-Gatherers, are the most genetically similar group to the Anatolian Hunter-Gatherer lineage. Feldman et al. suggest that this affinity is not due to a genetic flow from the AHG to the ancestors of the Villabruna cluster, but on the contrary: there was a genetic flow from the ancestors of the Villabruna cluster to the ancestors of the AHG. The AHG diverged from Caucasus hunter-gatherer around 25,000 years ago.[citation needed] The individual analyzed belongs to Y-chromosomal haplogroup C1a2 (C-V20), which has been found in some of the early WHGs, and mitochondrial haplogroup K2b.

      "  Her research activities also include pluripotency and reprogramming, polycomb repressor complexes in stem cells, cohesion function in gene expression and genome organisation with Ikaros family transcription factors (TFs). She uses current technologies to address events involved in maintaining embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency versus differentiation towards mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm, as well as the mechanisms of T cell and B cell lineage choice and differentiation. Fisher's discoveries in HIV were extensive and critical for future research of the virus's characteristics. She produced the first functional copies of HIV, allowing her and other scientists to access biologically active material for future research of the virus's genes. She determined the roles of several of the genes in HIV. These findings have been significant in studying and understanding different characteristics of HIV and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). At the NIH, Fisher developed approaches that allowed the successful introduction of exogenous DNA onto human blood cells. Two methods, protoplast fusion and electroporation, proved successful and allowed Fisher to test whether molecular clones isolated from HIV-infected cultures could generate infectious retrovirus upon transfection.[citation needed] Fisher showed in 1985 that molecular clones of HIV, contained within approximately 18kb of contiguous proviral DNA, were biologically active and generated cytopathic virus when introduced into primary human T-cells.[citation needed] This established that products of the viral genome itself, rather than a cofactor or contaminant, were capable of killing human T cells and were therefore potentially capable of mediating the immunosuppressive effect of HIV. It provided the basis for dissecting the molecular function of each of the viral genes and for developing DNA-based diagnostic tests for HIV infection.[citation needed] Over the following four years, Fisher showed that the transactivator gene tat was essential for virus replication, that truncation of the 3' open reading frame (ORF) disrupts virus cytopathogenicity, and that sor (now called vif) is required for efficient cell to cell transmission of HIV virus. With clinical collaboration from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Fisher showed that patient antisera displayed type-specific neutralising properties and that multiple HIV isolates derived from a single patient were biologically diverse and contained replication-competent as well as replication-incompetent cytopathic variants.[citation needed] Fisher moved from the US to the UK in 1987 to study human T cell development. She established the first human thymus organ cultures in 1990, based on studies pioneered by Owen and Jenkinson in the mouse.[citation needed] This refinement allowed cell-fate to be mapped in vitro and provided a system in which potential factors that shape the human T cell repertoire could be experimentally tested.[citation needed] She spent a further 3 years training in mouse genetics, transgenic and knockout technologies at the Institut de génétique et de biologie moléculaire et cellulaire (IGBMC) Strasbourg, before being invited by the Medical Research Council to establish a research team with her partner Matthias Merkenschlager at what was then the Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC).[citation needed] Fisher joined the CSC in 1993, and subsequently became its director in 2008.[citation needed] At the CSC her work has focused on understanding gene regulation during cell commitment. In January 2017, the CSC was renamed the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (MRC LMS).[citation needed] In 1997, Fisher's group published an important paper on the DNA-binding factor Ikaros, that at the time was presumed to be a transcriptional activator.[citation needed] Fisher's group showed that Ikaros proteins unexpectedly localised to percentric heterochromatin in cycling lymphocytes in association with transcriptionally silent genes.[citation needed] This provided some of the first evidence that where a gene is located inside the nucleus may be relevant for its expression. The development of three dimensional (3D) immuno-FISH techniques by Fisher's team, in which the protein structure and the nuclear architecture of a sample remains preserved, was critical for revealing the spatial distribution of chromosomes and the genes within the nucleus.[citation needed] In the last 15 years, analogous approaches have been widely used to interrogate the relationship between gene function and nuclear organisation. For example, studies showed that Ikaros- target genes in T and B cells were recruited to pericentric heterochromatin domains only when gene silencing was inherited by daughter cells.[citation needed] This study, together with others, established that the nuclear location, physical compaction and local chromatin environment of many genes was important for maintaining heritable silencing. Subsequent studies to characterise the differences between transient and heritable/permanent silencing revealed that several silent genes that were assumed to replicate late during synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell cycle (based on Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) detection of doublet signals), actually replicated much earlier (based on quantitative increases in DNA content). This discovery in 2003, led Fisher and Merkenschlager to hypothesis that – rather than altering the time of DNA replication – heritable gene silencing could retard chromatid separation and resolution. From this viewpoint they began a series of studies that have subsequently shown the involvement of cohesin complexes in gene regulation and in 2002, Fisher was awarded the EMBO Gold Medal in recognition of her early work on HIV, and the role of nuclear organisation in gene regulation. Since 2003, Fisher has been studying gene regulation in embryonic stem cells (ES), as a model for understanding pluripotency, lineage commitment and lineage restriction.[citation needed] In 2006, she showed that the promoters of many lineage-specifying genes in ES cells were simultaneously enriched for modified histones thought to mark either active genes (such as acetylation of H3K9, di- and tri-methylation of H3K4), or repressed domains ( such as tri-methylation of H3K27).[citation needed] This discovery ran contrary to the prevailing dogma of the time: that chromatin markers of actively transcribed and inactive domains were mutually exclusive.[citation needed] The study was published in 2006, contemporaneously with similar reports from several US-based groups. suggesting that important developmental regulator genes might be poised for transcription in ES cells, yet repressed by the activity of Polycomb Repressor Complexes (PRCs).[citation needed] Fisher was elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2001 and awarded the EMBO Gold Medal in 2002 in recognition of her work on nuclear organisation and gene expression, as well as for her research on the molecular characterisation of the HIV/AIDS. In 2014, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Her nomination reads: Amanda Fisher is distinguished for her pioneering work on HIV pathogenesis, T lymphocyte development, embryonic stem cells and epigenetic gene regulation.

      " 1% and 33% of the direct childcare received by a child. Older sisters appear to be more important than brothers for many of the groups in the study with sisters ranging from 5% - 33% and brothers 1.1% - 16.3%. Ivey (see Figures 1 & 2) found that among the Efe, both sisters and brothers contributed significantly to childcare. Sear and Mace found that five of the six studies indicated that child mortality increased survival of younger siblings. Older siblings, while still dependent on their parents. can engage in a variety of useful tasks depending on their age. It is possible that dependence on adult allomothers was not an early selective pressure for the development of allomothering in humans, but rather maternal – juvenile cooperation likely played a more important role. Older sisters often engage in childcare, helping to look after younger siblings. This is apparently true regardless of subsistence strategy; and holds true even for Industrial societies. Kramer (see Figure 4) shows a cross cultural comparison of children in ten societies, all of whom engage in at least some childcare of younger siblings. Equally important, older children can help offset their own cost by engaging in foraging or economic actives. The same figure from Kramer shows that all of the groups engaged in more economic work than childcare. Kramer (see Figure 2) compares groups organized by subsistence strategy and shows that foraging and economic work are common among foragers, horticulturalists, agriculturalists and pastoralists, with the latter two groups showing some of the highest rates of food production and domestic tasks by children. Other kin may be sources of allomothers when present, however evidence from the ethnographic literature demonstrates varied amounts of contribution and different impacts on the children. Aunts' and uncles' contribution varies depending on residential patterns, inheritance patterns and resource allocation. Among the Kipsigis of Kenya, a child's paternal uncle had a positive effect on reducing child mortality in the richer half of the sample but not on the poorer half, however for maternal uncles the effects were reversed with poorer families showing a greater reduction in child mortality. Local resource competition, namely conflict over land inheritance among the father's brothers appears to account for the pattern of paternal kin effects. Others have found that the maternal aunts have similar effects in societies with female inheritance. Efe infants spend a significant amount of time in the care of aunts and male cousins. Studies of extant hunter-gatherer groups demonstrates that groups are composed of more than just direct kin, with between 25 – 50% of group members as unrelated or distantly related. Using modern hunter-gatherers as representatives of past hunter-gathers is not a perfect analogy, the data in combination with archaeological and paleoanthropological evidence are the only sources of information we can use to reconstruct past groups. It is likely that past hunter-gatherer groups were also composed of a mixture of related (kin) and unrelated (non kin) individuals meaning that allomothering by non kin occurred in at least some past societies. Research with contemporary hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, and modern, industrial societies often finds that non-kin – friends, neighbors, and fictive kin – provide allomaternal care. Surrogate breast feeders, known as a wet nurses in Western medical literature, may have played an important role as allomothers prior to the introduction of bottle feeding and formula. Wet nursing was recorded in ancient Israel and Egypt, among historical and modern Sunni Arab populations, as well as in ancient India and Greece. While the frequency of wet nurses has been debated, there is ample references in the literature to suggest that is did occur (and in some societies still does). Religion and religious communities may also increase the frequency of allomothering. Studies of religious communities in England and New Zealand show increased allomaternal care by unrelated members of the community. Religion is thought to increase prosocial behavior with religiosity being a costly signal that indicates to other members that a practicing individual is trustworthy and likely to cooperate and reciprocate. Israeli kibbutz are collective settlements where members share almost all aspects of their lives: all incomes are given to the kibbutz an in return the kibbutz distributes goods and services equally, they dine in communal dining halls and childcare is communal. Children live in a communal nursery and later group houses together. Parenting is also distributed among the community; perhaps an extreme form of allomothering. Fictive kin are unrelated individuals that have kinship terms bestowed on them. There are generally two types of fictive kin: named kin, determined by factors such as age, gender and prestige and applied to a large number of community members (such as in Northern India), and ritual kin, named at a specific ceremony, such as baptism, at which time the relationship between the individual undergoing the ceremony and the named kin is formalized. Named kin may function similarly to religious communities by increasing familiarity and increasing prosocial behavior, however little research appears to have been conducted on this form of fictive kin. Godparents are one of the better-known ritual kin systems in Western culture. Godparents are common to Catholic (and other Christian) communities in Europe and throughout the Americas (due to colonization). Godparents are expected to provide extra resources to the family; naming a godparent creates a strong bond within the community or a tie to an outside community where new resources may be accessible in times of need\n",

Kramer (see Figure 4) shows a cross cultural comparison of children in ten societies, all of whom engage in at least some childcare of younger siblings.\n",

In the field, these units are usually one to five meters thick and contain several different rock units. These units show quick changes in sea level that were controlled by climate change due to glaciers. The fifth order is often called a cyclothem and may contain several PAC sequences and generally represent about 500,000 years. Again, glaciation seems to be the cause of the cyclic nature of the strata. The first four orders, though, are controlled more by continental shifts and orogenic cycles. The first order cycle being the Absaroka, the second being the Carboniferous Period, and third order being rock formations or groups which are generally 8 to 10 million years long.

      "  Upon injection of the radioactive protein into rabbits, the radioactivity of the entire asialoglycoprotein (rather than a portion of the protein) quickly moved from the blood into the liver. This rapid movement from the blood into the liver only occurred if the sialic acid of the protein was removed; i.e., if the protein had an exposed galactose residue (that would normally be covered by the sialic acid). Thus, it was concluded that a receptor is capable of recognizing asialoglycoproteins (i.e., proteins that have lost their terminal sialic acids) and removing them from circulation by transporting them to the liver. Asialoglycoprotein receptors function to catabolize galactosyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl-containing substrates. More specifically, in most mammals, the asialoglycoprotein receptor removes glycoproteins that have had some of their sugars, particularly a terminal sialic acid, removed from the end of the protein. The human asialoglycoprotein receptors composed of two units, H1 and H2. Each of these units have their N-terminus within the cytoplasm of a liver cell, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) on the extracellular side. The CRD functions to bind to asialoglycoproteins through a calcium ion-mediated interaction. In particular, the hydroxyl groups of the terminal sugars (usually galactose) of the asialoglycoprotein form hydrogen bonds with the CRD of the asialoglycoprotein receptor; proper positioning and facilitation of these hydrogen bonds is caused by the presence of Ca2+. The affinity of the ASGPR-ASGP interaction is dependent on factors including the number of sugars present on the ASGP. For example, ASGPs with a one galactose have a higher dissociation constant (i.e., a lower affinity interaction) compared an ASGP with several sugars attached. This increased affinity in the presence of more sugars is likely due to the formation of more interactions between the carbohydrate recognition domain of the ASGPR and the sugars on the ASGP. The affinity of the interaction is also mediated by the modifications of the terminal galactose; for example, ASGPs with N-acetylgalactosamine have a higher affinity interaction for the ASGPR compared to ASGPs with a galactose.

      "  The original result of Alfred Tauber (1897) stated that if we assume also an = o(1/n) (see Little o notation) and the radial limit exists, then the series obtained by setting z = 1 is actually convergent. This was strengthened by John Edensor Littlewood: we need only assume O(1/n). A sweeping generalization is the Hardy–Littlewood Tauberian theorem. In the abstract setting, therefore, an Abelian theorem states that the domain of L contains the convergent sequences, and its values there are equal to those of the Lim functional. A Tauberian theorem states, under some growth condition, that the domain of L is exactly the convergent sequences and no more. If one thinks of L as some generalised type of weighted average, taken to the limit, a Tauberian theorem allows one to discard the weighting, under the correct hypotheses. There are many applications of this kind of result in number theory, in particular in handling Dirichlet series. The development of the field of Tauberian theorems received a fresh turn with Norbert Wiener's very general results, namely Wiener's Tauberian theorem and its large collection of corollaries. The central theorem can now be proved by Banach algebra methods, and contains much, though not all, of the previous theory.

      "  AFFRI later assisted environmental cleanup efforts Semipatatinck Soviet nuclear test site in modern Kazakhstan. The late-70s saw AFRRI greatly increase its biomedical staff to address military radiation injury concerns. The Defense Nuclear Agency transferred control of AFRRI to the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) in 1993. The end of the Cold War saw AFRRI's funding and personnel levels diminish and its termination proposed. However, the lack of alternative research institutions led to military leaders' decision to keep AFRRI operational. American interest in nuclear preparedness resurged in the late-1990s as India and Pakistan developed and tested nuclear weapons and suspicions grew that Iraq and North Korea sought to do the same. As private companies lacked the incentive to develop radioprotectants (drugs protecting against radiation damage) and countermeasures for the military, funding for AFRRI was increased in 2000. Post-9/11 fears of terrorist threats also stimulated support for AFFRI. The attacks helped expand AFRRI's scope of work to include minimizing the effects of radiological dispersal devices (i.e. dirty bombs), terrorist access to radiation sources, and sabotage of nuclear reactors. Despite this, AFRRI remained limited by a lack of proper funding, facilities, and personnel. Extra support granted in 2003 and 2004 allowed for infrastructural upgrades and the development of a radioprotective drug, 5-androstenediol. As of the 2010s and 2020s, AFRRI is DOD's only medical research and development initiative dedicated to nuclear and radiological defense. It serves the military by performing medical research and development, education, and advisory and consultative functions to increase understanding of the effects and risks of ionizing radiation. AFRRI is charged with executing DoD's Medical Radiological Defense Research Program. Its civilian and active duty military personnel conduct exploratory and developmental research to identify and develop medical countermeasures against ionizing radiation. Core areas of study include prevention, assessment, and treatment of radiological injuries. The program seeks to develop prophylactic (disease preventing) and therapeutic drugs, such as Ex-Rad, that prevent and treat radiation injuries and to develop rapid high-precision analytical methods that assess radiation exposure doses from clinical samples and thus aid in the triage and medical management of radiological casualties. New drug candidates and biological dose assessment technologies are developed up to and through preclinical testing and evaluation. Primary research areas of the Institute include biodosimetry, combined injury (radiation with other medical insults), internal contamination and metal toxicity, medical countermeasure development, animal welfare, assessment of radiation injury, and radiation facilities. AFRRI's research focuses on its goals to: Develop methods of rapidly assessing radiation exposure to assure appropriate medical treatment Pursue new drugs that will prevent the life-threatening and health-degrading effects of ionizing radiation and move those drugs from discovery through the Food and Drug Administration approval process Investigate the effects of radiation injury combined with other challenges such as trauma, disease, and chemical exposures Contribute to the knowledge base that is useful in understanding, for example, the effects of space radiation on astronauts AFRRI is charged with the following: Operating research facilities for and disseminate results from the study of radiobiology and ionizing radiation bioeffects and the development of medical countermeasures against ionizing radiation Providing analysis, study, and consultation on the impact of the biological effects of ionizing radiation on the organizational efficiency of the U.S. military services and their members Conducting cooperative research with military medical departments in those aspects of military and operational and medical support considerations related to nuclear weapons effects and the radiobiological hazards of space operations Conducting advanced training in the field of radiobiology and the biological effects of nuclear and radiobiological weapons to meet the internal requirements of AFRRI, the military services, and other DoD components and organizations Participating in cooperative research and other enterprises, consistent with the AFRRI mission and applicable authorities, with other federal agencies involved in homeland security and emergency medical preparedness Informing and appraising department, government, academic, corporate, and other nongovernmental organizations of its (AFRRI's) activities Performing other such functions as may be assigned by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) Overseeing DoD's Medical Radiological Defense Research Program AFRRI is a joint entity of the three military departments and is subject to the authority and direction of the president of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, and Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. The institute is led by a Director and Scientific Director. The director of the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute is appointed by the surgeons general of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to a four-year term. Additionally, the director must hold a doctoral degree in the life sciences and be a military officer. It is the director's responsibility to act as liaison to the heads of DoD's components and other governmental and nongovernmental agencies and to ensure that other DoD components are appraised of AFRRI's activities. All directors have been captains or colonels. The current director is Col. Dr. Mohammed Naeem as of August 2021. Subordinate to the director are a deputy director, secretary, scientific advisor, radiation safety officer, director for administration, senior enlisted advisor, and chief of staff (overseeing a chief of finance and deputy chief of staff). AFRRI's scientific director exercises scientific leadership and the administration and supervision of the institute's research-oriented departments and the overall scientific and technical planning of the research program. He or she also serves as the scientific liaison to outside entities. There is also a scientific advisor who counsels the director and acts as a liaison with outside agencies but is not a part of the chain of command. Generally, scientific directors are civilian Ph.D.-holders. AFRRI's Board of Governors, which once meet at least once every year, comprises the following members: Chairman: Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (PDASD(HA)) Executive Secretary: Director of AFRRI The Surgeons General of the Army, Navy, and Air Force The Deputy Chiefs of Staff for Operations of the Army, Navy, and Air Force The Joint Staff Surgeon The president of USUHS A representative of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs (see Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical & Biological Defense Programs) Any additional representatives of DoD Components or other federal agencies chosen by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs|ASD(HA) As of 2014, AFRRI comprised the following departments, each headed by a department head or manager: Radiation Sciences Scientific Research Military Medical Operations Veterinary Sciences Facilities Management Good Laboratory Practice/Test Facility Administration Support AFFRI subdivides its laboratory research program into four area-specific laboratories and one center discussed in length in this page's Laboratories, center, and equipment section\n",

      " The Azoic hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the Abyssus theory) is a superseded scientific theory proposed by Edward Forbes in 1843, stating that the abundance and variety of marine life decreased with increasing depth and, by extrapolation of his own measurements, Forbes calculated that marine life would cease to exist below 300 fathoms (1,800 ft; 550 m). The theory was based upon Forbes' findings aboard HMS Beacon (1832), a survey ship to which he had been appointed naturalist by the ship's commander Captain Thomas Graves. With Forbes aboard, HMS Beacon set sail around the Aegean Sea on 17 April 1841, from Malta. It was at this point that Forbes began to take dredging samples at various depths of the ocean, he observed that samples from greater depths displayed a narrower diversity of creatures which were generally smaller in size. Forbes reported his findings from the Aegean Sea in his 1843 report to the British Association entitled Report on the Mollusca and Radiata of the Aegean Sea. His findings were widely accepted by the scientific community and were bolstered by other scientific figures of the time. David Page (1814–1879), a respected geologist, reinforced the theory by stating that \"according to experiment, water at the depth of 1000 feet is compressed 1⁄340th of its own bulk; and at this rate of compression we know that at great depths animal and vegetable life as known to us cannot possibly exist – the extreme depressions of seas being thus, like the extreme elevations of the land, barren and lifeless solitudes.\" The theory was not disproven until the late 1860s when biologist Michael Sars, Professor of Zoology at Christiania (now Oslo) University, discovered life at a depth greater than 300 fathoms. Sars listed 427 animal species which had been found along the Norwegian coast at a depth of 450 fathoms, and gave a description of a crinoid Rhizocrinus lofotensis which his son had recovered from a depth of 300 fathoms in Lofoten. In 1869, Charles Wyville Thomson dredged marine life from a depth of 2,345 fathoms (14,070 ft; 4,289 m), finally dispelling Forbes' azoic theory. In light of this evidence, the Azoic hypothesis would come to be seen as a false hypothesis and give way to vastly increased efforts in deep-sea exploration and associated marine life. Since being discredited, the theory has been referenced widely in popular culture[citation needed] and alluded to in documentaries that explore and showcase deep-sea marine life.

      "  These can be computed using limits and classified into horizontal, vertical and oblique asymptotes depending on their orientation. Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as x tends to +∞ or −∞. As the name indicates they are parallel to the x-axis. Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines (perpendicular to the x-axis) near which the function grows without bound. Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines such that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as x tends to +∞ or −∞. The line x = a is a vertical asymptote of the graph of the function y = ƒ(x) if at least one of the following statements is true: lim x → a − f ( x ) = ± ∞ , {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to a^{-}}f(x)=\\pm \\infty ,} lim x → a + f ( x ) = ± ∞ , {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to a^{+}}f(x)=\\pm \\infty ,} where lim x → a − {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to a^{-}}} is the limit as x approaches the value a from the left (from lesser values), and lim x → a + {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to a^{+}}} is the limit as x approaches a from the right. For example, if ƒ(x) = x/(x–1), the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as x approaches 1. So lim x → 1 + x x − 1 = + ∞ {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to 1^{+}}{\\frac {x}{x-1}}=+\\infty } lim x → 1 − x x − 1 = − ∞ {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to 1^{-}}{\\frac {x}{x-1}}=-\\infty } and the curve has a vertical asymptote x = 1. The function ƒ(x) may or may not be defined at a, and its precise value at the point x = a does not affect the asymptote. For example, for the function f ( x ) = { 1 x if  x > 0 , 5 if  x ≤ 0. {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\begin{cases}{\\frac {1}{x}}&{\\text{if }}x>0,\\\\5&{\\text{if }}x\\leq 0.\\end{cases}}} has a limit of +∞ as x → 0+, ƒ(x) has the vertical asymptote x = 0, even though ƒ(0) = 5. The graph of this function does intersect the vertical asymptote once, at (0, 5). It is impossible for the graph of a function to intersect a vertical asymptote (or a vertical line in general) in more than one point. Moreover, if a function is continuous at each point where it is defined, it is impossible that its graph does intersect any vertical asymptote. A common example of a vertical asymptote is the case of a rational function at a point x such that the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero. If a function has a vertical asymptote, then it isn't necessarily true that the derivative of the function has a vertical asymptote at the same place. An example is f ( x ) = 1 x + sin ⁡ ( 1 x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)={\\tfrac {1}{x}}+\\sin({\\tfrac {1}{x}})\\quad } at x = 0 {\\displaystyle \\quad x=0} . This function has a vertical asymptote at x = 0 , {\\displaystyle x=0,} because lim x → 0 + f ( x ) = lim x → 0 + ( 1 x + sin ⁡ ( 1 x ) ) = + ∞ , {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to 0^{+}}f(x)=\\lim _{x\\to 0^{+}}\\left({\\tfrac {1}{x}}+\\sin \\left({\\tfrac {1}{x}}\\right)\\right)=+\\infty ,} and lim x → 0 − f ( x ) = lim x → 0 − ( 1 x + sin ⁡ ( 1 x ) ) = − ∞ {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to 0^{-}}f(x)=\\lim _{x\\to 0^{-}}\\left({\\tfrac {1}{x}}+\\sin \\left({\\tfrac {1}{x}}\\right)\\right)=-\\infty } . The derivative of f {\\displaystyle f} is the function f ′ ( x ) = − ( cos ⁡ ( 1 x ) + 1 ) x 2 {\\displaystyle f'(x)={\\frac {-(\\cos({\\tfrac {1}{x}})+1)}{x^{2}}}} . For the sequence of points x n = ( − 1 ) n ( 2 n + 1 ) π , {\\displaystyle x_{n}={\\frac {(-1)^{n}}{(2n+1)\\pi }},\\quad } for n = 0 , 1 , 2 , … {\\displaystyle \\quad n=0,1,2,\\ldots } that approaches x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0} both from the left and from the right, the values f ′ ( x n ) {\\displaystyle f'(x_{n})} are constantly 0 {\\displaystyle 0} . Therefore, both one-sided limits of f ′ {\\displaystyle f'} at 0 {\\displaystyle 0} can be neither + ∞ {\\displaystyle +\\infty } nor − ∞ {\\displaystyle -\\infty } . Hence f ′ ( x ) {\\displaystyle f'(x)} doesn't have a vertical asymptote at x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0} . Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as x → ±∞. The horizontal line y = c is a horizontal asymptote of the function y = ƒ(x) if lim x → − ∞ f ( x ) = c {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\rightarrow -\\infty }f(x)=c} or lim x → + ∞ f ( x ) = c {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\rightarrow +\\infty }f(x)=c} . In the first case, ƒ(x) has y = c as asymptote when x tends to −∞, and in the second ƒ(x) has y = c as an asymptote as x tends to +∞. For example, the arctangent function satisfies lim x → − ∞ arctan ⁡ ( x ) = − π 2 {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\rightarrow -\\infty }\\arctan(x)=-{\\frac {\\pi }{2}}} and lim x → + ∞ arctan ⁡ ( x ) = π 2 . {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\rightarrow +\\infty }\\arctan(x)={\\frac {\\pi }{2}}.} So the line y = –π/2 is a horizontal asymptote for the arctangent when x tends to –∞, and y = π/2 is a horizontal asymptote for the arctangent when x tends to +∞. Functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions. For example, the function ƒ(x) = 1/(x2+1) has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 when x tends both to −∞ and +∞ because, respectively, lim x → − ∞ 1 x 2 + 1 = lim x → + ∞ 1 x 2 + 1 = 0. {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to -\\infty }{\\frac {1}{x^{2}+1}}=\\lim _{x\\to +\\infty }{\\frac {1}{x^{2}+1}}=0.} Other common functions that have one or two horizontal asymptotes include x ↦ 1/x (that has an hyperbola as it graph), the Gaussian function x ↦ exp ⁡ ( − x 2 ) , {\\displaystyle x\\mapsto \\exp(-x^{2}),} the error function, and the logistic function. When a linear asymptote is not parallel to the x- or y-axis, it is called an oblique asymptote or slant asymptote. A function ƒ(x) is asymptotic to the straight line y = mx + n (m ≠ 0) if lim x → + ∞ [ f ( x ) − ( m x + n ) ] = 0  or  lim x → − ∞ [ f ( x ) − ( m x + n ) ] = 0. {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to +\\infty }\\left[f(x)-(mx+n)\\right]=0\\,{\\mbox{ or }}\\lim _{x\\to -\\infty }\\left[f(x)-(mx+n)\\right]=0.} In the first case the line y = mx + n is an oblique asymptote of ƒ(x) when x tends to +∞, and in the second case the line y = mx + n is an oblique asymptote of ƒ(x) when x tends to −∞. An example is ƒ(x) = x + 1/x, which has the oblique asymptote y = x (that is m = 1, n = 0) as seen in the limits lim x → ± ∞ [ f ( x ) − x ] {\\displaystyle \\lim _{x\\to \\pm \\infty }\\left[f(x)-x\\right]} = lim x → ± ∞ [ ( x + 1 x ) − x ] {\\displaystyle =\\lim _{x\\to \\pm \\infty }\\left[\\left(x+{\\frac {1}{x}}\\right)-x\\right]} = lim x → ± ∞ 1 x = 0. {\\displaystyle =\\lim _{x\\to \\pm \\infty }{\\frac {1}{x}}=0.} The asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits (although the derivations of such methods typically use limits)\n",

      "  of Sci. 1975—1995 discovered new types of instabilities in gravitating media. 1971—1985 created the theory of planet rings and predicted Uranus satellites that were later discovered. 1972—1996 created hydrodynamic theory of the spiral structure in galaxies. In plasma physics, Fridman predicted the existence of the Alfven's solutions, and worked out the stability theory of thermonuclear plasma at finite high pressure. In hydrodynamics, developed the theory of the three strongest instabilities of hydrodynamics: tangential discontinuity, centrifugal, and over-reflection instability. In space physics: with his students, developed the linear theory of stability of classical figures of equilibrium in collisionless stellar systems, and laid the foundations of the nonlinear theory of stability and turbulence of gravitating media. As a result, the ranges of the parameters were derived for stability of stellar systems of different geometries. Fridman discovered new types of non-Jeans instabilities in gravitating media, some of which develop at timescales less than Jeans' timescale, while others exist in systems that are stable according to Jeans. With V. Polyachenko, Fridman derived a new type of asinphase eigen oscillations that exist in multi-component gravitating media as non-collapsing waves with the wavelength above the critical (that would be impossible in a single-component media). In Fridman's works, it was first shown that solitons can exist in gravitating media, and transform into gravitating shock waves if dissipation is present. A. Fridman broke the traditional view that shock waves cannot exist in collisionless stellar systems, and proved the existence of \"collisionless\" shock waves in rotating stellar discs where the free path is the size of the epicycle. Fridman first showed that Landau nonlinear damping can exist in stellar systems. In the field of physics of planetary rings, Fridman with N. Gorkavyi developed the theory of transfer, collective and resonance processes in a system of non-elastic collisional gravitating particles, that explained the hierarchical structure of the Saturn rings, the resonance nature of the Uran rings, and allowed to predict the small satellites of Uran. The last theoretical prediction was then confirmed when 9 of the 10 satellites discovered by Voyager 2 were found in the predicted regions, with four on the pre-calculated orbits at less than 0.5% error. In collaboration with colleagues, Fridman developed the hydrodynamic theory of galactic spiral structure generation. The theory was proved in an original experiment on rotating shallow water that was engineered at Kurchatov Research Center. Using results of this experiment, also giant anticyclones in discs of spiral galaxies were predicted. The anticyclones were later observed, derived from maps of galactic velocities (data from the 6 meter telescope RAS. With O. Khoruzhii, Fridman developed nonlinear dynamics of astrophysics discs, deriving formation of mono and dipole vortices in discs, and the new type of accretion - acoustic drift - features that were later detected in planetary rings, and in the gas disc of our Galaxy. Fridman developed the theory of weak turbulence for rotating gravitating systems that explains the correlation between main parameters of gas clouds and their structure in our Galaxy, and the observed mass spectrum of the clouds. Seismodynamics and Ocean physics: with colleagues, Fridman discovered two components of the Earth's seismic activity: global and mirror. Calculated components of deformation tensor on the Earth surface (polygon in Kyrgyzstan, using 510 GPS stations over 1100 x 500 km^2) and showed correlation between the maxima of these components and the seismic activity regions. With collaborators in Tel Aviv University, Fridman developed a program in modeling and destruction of tsunami. Fridman was one of the 46 people who signed \"the letter of the 46\" in 1968 protesting against the closed court proceedings of four Moscow dissidents: A. Ginzburg, Yu. Galanskov, A. Dobrovolskii, and V. Lashkova, addressed to the Supreme Court of Russian Federal Republic and to the Attorney General of the USSR. The text of the letter was published in the New York Times on March 23, 1968. A massive internal political campaign of repressions followed; Fridman was fired from Novosibirsk University, but continued to hold a position at the Institute of Nuclear Physics.

Its senses are also used to find potential mates, and it has been discovered squealing at times when mating occurs. There are several threats that have endangered the survival of S. obscurus. These threats involve the destruction and maturation of habitat, as well as habitat fragmentation which is due to urban development. Once fragmentation has occurred the lack of cover exposes the cottontail to predators, increasing the strain on the species. Hunting is a common reason for deaths of many Appalachian cottontails but is mostly due to lack of knowledge by the hunter. The lack of knowledge of this species, because it is so secretive and rarely found in the wild, also contributes to its being threatened. Barry, R.; Lanier, H.C. (2019). \"Sylvilagus obscurus\".

      " The Appalachian cottontail has adapted to its role of prey, and because of this it typically has heightened senses of smell, hearing, and sight. This allows for the rabbit to notice predators and react quickly to threats. Mothers have been observed performing a grunting sound in order to alert offspring to the presence of predators. Its senses are also used to find potential mates, and it has been discovered squealing at times when mating occurs There are several threats that have endangered the survival of S. obscurus. These threats involve the destruction and maturation of habitat, as well as habitat fragmentation which is due to urban development. Once fragmentation has occurred the lack of cover exposes the cottontail to predators, increasing the strain on the species.\n",

      "  For example, eight positive unit tiles can be added to both sides. Zero pairs of unit tiles are removed from the left side, leaving one positive x {\\displaystyle x} tile. The right side has 14 positive unit tiles, so x = 14 {\\displaystyle x=14} . Algebra tile model of x − 6 = 2 {\\displaystyle x-6=2} Algebra tile model of x − 6 + 6 = 2 + 6 {\\displaystyle x-6+6=2+6} Algebra tile model of x = 8 {\\displaystyle x=8} The equation x + 7 = 10 {\\displaystyle x+7=10} can be modeled with one positive x {\\displaystyle x} tile and seven positive unit tiles on the left side and 10 positive unit tiles on the right side. Rather than adding the same number of tiles to both sides, the same number of tiles can be subtracted from both sides. For example, seven positive unit tiles can be removed from both sides. This leaves one positive x {\\displaystyle x} tile on the left side and three positive unit tiles on the right side, so x = 3 {\\displaystyle x=3} . Algebra tile model of x + 7 = 10 {\\displaystyle x+7=10} Algebra tile model of x = 3 {\\displaystyle x=3} When using algebra tiles to multiply a monomial by a monomial, the student must first set up a rectangle where the length of the rectangle is the one monomial and then the width of the rectangle is the other monomial, similar to when one multiplies integers using algebra tiles. Once the sides of the rectangle are represented by the algebra tiles, one would then try to figure out which algebra tiles would fill in the rectangle. For instance, if one had x×x, the only algebra tile that would complete the rectangle would be x2, which is the answer. Multiplication of binomials is similar to multiplication of monomials when using the algebra tiles . Multiplication of binomials can also be thought of as creating a rectangle where the factors are the length and width. As with the monomials, one would set up the sides of the rectangle to be the factors and then fill in the rectangle with the algebra tiles. This method of using algebra tiles to multiply polynomials is known as the area model and it can also be applied to multiplying monomials and binomials with each other. An example of multiplying binomials is (2x+1)×(x+2) and the first step the student would take is set up two positive x tiles and one positive unit tile to represent the length of a rectangle and then one would take one positive x tile and two positive unit tiles to represent the width. These two lines of tiles would create a space that looks like a rectangle which can be filled in with certain tiles. In the case of this example the rectangle would be composed of two positive x2 tiles, five positive x tiles, and two positive unit tiles. So the solution is 2x2+5x+2. In order to factor using algebra tiles, one has to start out with a set of tiles that the student combines into a rectangle, this may require the use of adding zero pairs in order to make the rectangular shape. An example would be where one is given one positive x2 tile, three positive x tiles, and two positive unit tiles. The student forms the rectangle by having the x2 tile in the upper right corner, then one has two x tiles on the right side of the x2 tile, one x tile underneath the x2 tile, and two unit tiles are in the bottom right corner. By placing the algebra tiles to the sides of this rectangle we can determine that we need one positive x tile and one positive unit tile for the length and then one positive x tile and two positive unit tiles for the width. This means that the two factors are x + 1 {\\displaystyle x+1} and x + 2 {\\displaystyle x+2} . In a sense this is the reverse of the procedure for multiplying polynomials. Kitt 2000. Stein 2000.

The test statistic R is calculated in the following way: R = r B − r W M / 2 {\\displaystyle R={\\frac {r_{B}-r_{W}}{M/2}}} where rB is the average of rank similarities of pairs of samples (or replicates) originating from different sites, rW is the average of rank similarity of pairs among replicates within sites, and M = n(n − 1)/2 where n is the number of samples. The test statistic R is constrained between the values −1 to 1, where positive numbers suggest more similarity within sites and values close to zero represent no difference between sites and within sites similarities. Negative R values suggest more similarity between sites than within sites and may raise the possibility of wrong assignment of samples to sites. For the purpose of hypothesis testing, where the null hypothesis is that the similarities within sites are smaller or equal to the similarities between sites, the R statistic is usually compared to a set of R′ values that are achieved by means of randomly shuffling site labels between the samples and calculating the resulting R′, repeated many times. The percent of times that the actual R surpassed the permutations derived R′ values is the p-value for the actual R statistic. Ranking of dissimilarity in ANOSIM and NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) go hand in hand. Combining both methods complement visualisation of group differences along with significance testing.

      "  (sequence A003226 in the OEIS). A fixed point of f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} is a zero of the function g ( x ) = f ( x ) − x {\\displaystyle g(x)=f(x)-x} . In the ring of integers modulo b {\\displaystyle b} , there are 2 ω ( b ) {\\displaystyle 2^{\\omega (b)}} zeroes to g ( x ) = x 2 − x {\\displaystyle g(x)=x^{2}-x} , where the prime omega function ω ( b ) {\\displaystyle \\omega (b)} is the number of distinct prime factors in b {\\displaystyle b} . An element x {\\displaystyle x} in Z / b Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /b\\mathbb {Z} } is a zero of g ( x ) = x 2 − x {\\displaystyle g(x)=x^{2}-x} if and only if x ≡ 0 mod p v p ( b ) {\\displaystyle x\\equiv 0{\\bmod {p}}^{v_{p}(b)}} or x ≡ 1 mod p v p ( b ) {\\displaystyle x\\equiv 1{\\bmod {p}}^{v_{p}(b)}} for all p | b {\\displaystyle p|b} . Since there are two possible values in { 0 , 1 } {\\displaystyle \\lbrace 0,1\\rbrace } , and there are ω ( b ) {\\displaystyle \\omega (b)} such p | b {\\displaystyle p|b} , there are 2 ω ( b ) {\\displaystyle 2^{\\omega (b)}} zeroes of g ( x ) = x 2 − x {\\displaystyle g(x)=x^{2}-x} , and thus there are 2 ω ( b ) {\\displaystyle 2^{\\omega (b)}} fixed points of f ( x ) = x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} . According to Hensel's lemma, if there are k {\\displaystyle k} zeroes or fixed points of a polynomial function modulo b {\\displaystyle b} , then there are k {\\displaystyle k} corresponding zeroes or fixed points of the same function modulo any power of b {\\displaystyle b} , and this remains true in the inverse limit. Thus, in any given base b {\\displaystyle b} there are 2 ω ( b ) {\\displaystyle 2^{\\omega (b)}} b {\\displaystyle b} -adic fixed points of f ( x ) = x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} . As 0 is always a zero-divisor, 0 and 1 are always fixed points of f ( x ) = x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} , and 0 and 1 are automorphic numbers in every base. These solutions are called trivial automorphic numbers. If b {\\displaystyle b} is a prime power, then the ring of b {\\displaystyle b} -adic numbers has no zero-divisors other than 0, so the only fixed points of f ( x ) = x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} are 0 and 1. As a result, nontrivial automorphic numbers, those other than 0 and 1, only exist when the base b {\\displaystyle b} has at least two distinct prime factors. All b {\\displaystyle b} -adic numbers are represented in base b {\\displaystyle b} , using A−Z to represent digit values 10 to 35. Automorphic numbers can be extended to any such polynomial function of degree n {\\displaystyle n} f ( x ) = ∑ i = 0 n a i x i {\\textstyle f(x)=\\sum _{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^{i}} with b-adic coefficients a i {\\displaystyle a_{i}} . These generalised automorphic numbers form a tree. An a {\\displaystyle a} -automorphic number occurs when the polynomial function is f ( x ) = a x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}} For example, with b = 10 {\\displaystyle b=10} and a = 2 {\\displaystyle a=2} , as there are two fixed points for f ( x ) = 2 x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}} in Z / 10 Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /10\\mathbb {Z} } ( x = 0 {\\displaystyle x=0} and x = 8 {\\displaystyle x=8} ), according to Hensel's lemma there are two 10-adic fixed points for f ( x ) = 2 x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=2x^{2}} , … 0000000000 {\\displaystyle \\ldots 0000000000} … 0893554688 {\\displaystyle \\ldots 0893554688} so the 2-automorphic numbers in base 10 are 0, 8, 88, 688, 4688... A trimorphic number or spherical number occurs when the polynomial function is f ( x ) = x 3 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{3}} . All automorphic numbers are trimorphic.

      "In mathematics, an automorphic number (sometimes referred to as a circular number) is a natural number in a given number base b {\\displaystyle b} whose square \"ends\" in the same digits as the number itself. Given a number base b {\\displaystyle b} , a natural number n {\\displaystyle n} with k {\\displaystyle k} digits is an automorphic number if n {\\displaystyle n} is a fixed point of the polynomial function f ( x ) = x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} over Z / b k Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /b^{k}\\mathbb {Z} } , the ring of integers modulo b k {\\displaystyle b^{k}} . As the inverse limit of Z / b k Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /b^{k}\\mathbb {Z} } is Z b {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{b}} , the ring of b {\\displaystyle b} -adic integers, automorphic numbers are used to find the numerical representations of the fixed points of f ( x ) = x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} over Z b {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} _{b}}  For example, with b = 10 {\\displaystyle b=10} , there are four 10-adic fixed points of f ( x ) = x 2 {\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}} , the last 10 digits of which are one of these … 0000000000 {\\displaystyle \\ldots 0000000000} … 0000000001 {\\displaystyle \\ldots 0000000001} … 8212890625 {\\displaystyle \\ldots 8212890625} (sequence A018247 in the OEIS) … 1787109376 {\\displaystyle \\ldots 1787109376} (sequence A018248 in the OEIS) Thus, the automorphic numbers in base 10 are 0, 1, 5, 6, 25, 76, 376, 625, 9376, 90625, 109376, 890625, 2890625, 7109376, 12890625, 87109376, 212890625, 787109376, 1787109376, 8212890625, 18212890625, 81787109376, 918212890625, 9918212890625, 40081787109376, 59918212890625, .\n",

      "A549 cells are adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells, and constitute a cell line that was first developed in 1972 by D. J. Giard, et al. through the removal and culturing of cancerous lung tissue in the explanted tumor of a 58-year-old caucasian male. The cells are used as models for the study of lung cancer and the development of drug therapies against it. A549 cells, as found in the lung tissue of their origin, are squamous and responsible for the diffusion of some substances, such as water and electrolytes, across alveoli. If A549 cells are cultured in vitro, they grow as a monolayer; adherent or attaching to the culture flask. The cells are able to synthesize lecithin and contain high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, which are important to maintain membrane phospholipids.\n",

      "  An increase in pressure due to a supernova or a spiral density wave can shift the gas from the warm phase to the unstable phase, with a magnetohydrodynamic wave then being able to produce dense fragments in the cold phase whose self-gravity is strong enough for them to collapse into stars.[citation needed] Many regular fluid dynamics equations are used in astrophysical fluid dynamics. Some of these equations are: Continuity equations The Navier–Stokes equations Euler's equations Conservation of mass The continuity equation is an extension of conservation of mass to fluid flow.[citation needed] Consider a fluid flowing through a fixed volume tank having one inlet and one outlet. If the flow is steady (no accumulation of fluid within the tank), then the rate of fluid flow at entry must be equal to the rate of fluid flow at the exit for mass conservation. If, at an entry (or exit) having a cross-sectional area A {\\displaystyle A} m2, a fluid parcel travels a distance d L {\\displaystyle dL} in time d t {\\displaystyle dt} , then the volume flow rate ( V {\\displaystyle V} m3 ⋅ {\\displaystyle \\cdot } s−1) is given by: V = A ⋅ d L Δ t {\\displaystyle V=A\\cdot {\\frac {dL}{\\Delta t}}} but since d L Δ t {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dL}{\\Delta t}}} is the fluid velocity ( v {\\displaystyle v} m ⋅ {\\displaystyle \\cdot } s−1) we can write: Q = V × A {\\displaystyle Q=V\\times A} The mass flow rate ( m {\\displaystyle m} kg ⋅ {\\displaystyle \\cdot } s−1) is given by the product of density and volume flow rate m = ρ ⋅ Q = ρ ⋅ V ⋅ A {\\displaystyle m=\\rho \\cdot Q=\\rho \\cdot V\\cdot A} [inconsistent] Because of conservation of mass, between two points in a flowing fluid we can write m 1 = m 2 {\\displaystyle m_{1}=m_{2}} .

      "  After his Habilitation he became lecturer in Göttingen 1931. He became a professor ordinarius at the Technical University of Danzig 1933–1936. In 1933 Butenandt signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State. In 1936 he applied for the directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut (later the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry) in Berlin-Dahlem while also joining the NSDAP on 1 May 1936 (party member No. 3716562). The earlier director of the Kaiser Wilhelm institute was Carl Neuberg, who had been removed for being a Jew. His work on rotenones was considered useful by the Nazi leadership as it could be useful for controlling lice among soldiers in the trenches. As the head of a leading institute, he applied for government funding on concentrated research labeled kriegswichtig (important for the war), some of which focused on military projects like the improvement of oxygen uptake for high-altitude bomber pilots. Adolf Windaus and Walter Schöller of Schering gave him the advice to work on hormones extracted from ovaries. This research lead to the discovery of estrone and other primary female sex hormones, which were extracted from several thousand liters of urine. While working as professor in Danzig at the Chemisches Institut he was continuing his works over hormones extracting progesterone in 1934 and testosterone a year later, the research results were along with the synthesis of steroids by Leopold Ružička considered significant enough to be awarded later by Nobel Committee in 1939. In 1940 he was involved in research on a hormone treatment to make long submarine voyages more comfortable for submariners in the Kriegsmarine. Butenand's involvement with the Nazi regime and various themes of research led to criticism after the war, and even after his death the exact nature of his political orientation during the Nazi era has never been fully resolved. When the institute moved to Tübingen in 1945 he became a professor at the University of Tübingen. In 1948 he was considered for the chair for physiological medicine at the University of Basel. He entered in negotiations but eventually was convinced to stay the chemical industry to stay in Germany. In 1956, when the institute relocated to Martinsried, a suburb of Munich, Butenandt became a professor at the University of Munich. He also served as president of the Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science following Otto Hahn from 1960 to 1972. Butenandt is credited with the discovery and naming of the silkworm moth pheromone Bombykol in 1959. Butenandt died in Munich in 1995, at the age of 91.

      "  It may also be related to the geometry of the underlying detachment fault and the varying amount of displacement along the surface of that detachment fault. An anticlinorium is a large anticline in which a series of minor anticlinal folds are superimposed. Examples include the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Purcell Anticlinorium in British Columbia and the Blue Ridge anticlinorium of northern Virginia and Maryland in the Appalachians, or the Nittany Valley in central Pennsylvania. Anticlines are usually developed above thrust faults, so any small compression and motion within the inner crust can have large effects on the upper rock stratum. Stresses developed during mountain building or during other tectonic processes can similarly warp or bend bedding and foliation (or other planar features). The more the underlying fault is tectonically uplifted, the more the strata will be deformed and must adapt to new shapes. The shape formed will also be very dependent on the properties and cohesion of the different types of rock within each layer. During the formation of flexural-slip folds, the different rock layers form parallel-slip folds to accommodate for buckling. A good way to visualize how the multiple layers are manipulated, is to bend a deck of cards and to imagine each card as a layer of rock stratum. The amount of slip on each side of the anticline increases from the hinge to the inflection point. Passive-flow folds form when the rock is so soft that it behaves like weak plastic and slowly flows. In this process different parts of the rock body move at different rates causing shear stress to gradually shift from layer to layer. There is no mechanical contrast between layers in this type of fold. Passive-flow folds are extremely dependent on the rock composition of the stratum and can typically occur in areas with high temperatures. Anticlines, structural domes, fault zones and stratigraphic traps are very favorable locations for oil and natural gas drilling. About 80 percent of the world's petroleum has been found in anticlinal traps. The low density of petroleum causes oil to buoyantly migrate out of its source rock and upward toward the surface until it is trapped and stored in reservoir rock such as sandstone or porous limestone. The oil becomes trapped along with water and natural gas by a caprock that is made up of impermeable barrier such as an impermeable stratum or fault zone. Examples of low-permeability seals that contain the hydrocarbons, oil and gas, in the ground include shale, limestone, sandstone, and rock salt. The actual type of stratum does not matter as long as it has low permeability. Water, minerals and specific rock strata such as limestone found inside anticlines are also extracted and commercialized. Lastly, ancient fossils are often found in anticlines and are used for paleontological research or harvested into products to be sold. Ghawar Anticline, Saudi Arabia, the structural trap for the largest conventional oil field in the world. Hill End Anticline, New South Wales, which is associated with deposits of gold. Castlemaine Anticlinal Fold, Victoria, which is celebrated with a plaque that says, \"This fine exhibit was disclosed when Lyttleton Street East was constructed in 1874. Saddle reefs occur in similar folds of the sandstones and slates on lower geological horizons.\" The Weald–Artois Anticline is a major anticline which outcrops in southeast England and northern France. It was formed from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene, during the Alpine orogeny. Anticlines can have a major effect on the local geomorphology and economy of the regions in which they occur. One example of this is the El Dorado anticline in Kansas. The anticline was first tapped into for its petroleum in 1918. Soon after the site became a very prosperous area for entrepreneurs following World War I and the rapid popularization of motor vehicles. By 1995 the El Dorado oil fields had produced 300 million barrels of oil. The central Kansas uplift is an antiform composed of several small anticlines that have collectively produced more than 2.5 million barrels of oil. Another notable anticline is the Tierra Amarilla anticline in San Ysidro, New Mexico. This is a popular hiking and biking site because of the great biodiversity, geologic beauty and paleontological resources. This plunging anticline is made up of Petrified Forest mudstones and sandstone and its caprock is made of Pleistocene and Holocene travertine. The anticline contains springs that deposit carbon dioxide travertine that help to contribute to the rich diversity of microorganisms. This area also contains remains of fossils and ancient plants from the Jurassic period that are sometimes exposed through geological erosion\n",

      " However, these studies could not unambiguously determine the first element with 5f electrons and therefore the first element in the actinide series. The discoveries of americium and curium under the hypothesis that they resembled the lanthanides prompted Seaborg to propose the concept of an actinide series to his colleagues in 1944 – with the central premise being similarity to the lanthanides and filling of f orbitals. Despite its apparent correctness, they did not recommend Seaborg to submit a communication to Chemical and Engineering News, fearing that it was a radical idea that would ruin his reputation. He nevertheless submitted it and it gained widespread acceptance; new periodic tables thus placed the actinides below the lanthanides Following its acceptance, the actinide concept proved pivotal in the groundwork for discoveries of heavier elements, such as berkelium in 1949.\n",

      " Insulin regulates adipogenesis through insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor signaling. Insulin/IGF1 promotes the induction transcription factors regulating terminal differentiation. Wnt/β-catenin signaling suppresses adipogenesis, by promoting the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into myocytes and osteocytes but blocking the commitment to the adipocytic lineage. Wnt/β-catenin inhibits the differentiation of preadipocytes by inhibiting the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily members. BMP2 can either stimulates the determination of multipotent cells or induce osteogenesis through different receptor heteromers. BMPs also promotes the differentiation of preadipocytes. Senescent adipose progenitor cells in subcutaneous adipose tissue has been shown to suppress adipogenic differentiation. Reduced adipogenesis in obese persons is due to increased senescent cells in adipose tissue rather than reduced numbers of stem/progenitor cells.\n",

As of 2020, it was published both in print and electronically. The Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science is helmed by the editor. The editor is assisted by the editorial committee, which includes associate editors, regular members, and occasionally guest editors. Guest members participate at the invitation of the editor, and serve terms of one year. All other members of the editorial committee are appointed by the Annual Reviews board of directors and serve five-year terms. The editorial committee determines which topics should be included in each volume and solicits reviews from qualified authors. Unsolicited manuscripts are not accepted. Peer review of accepted manuscripts is undertaken by the editorial committee. Dates indicate publication years in which someone was credited as a lead editor or co-editor of a journal volume. The planning process for a volume begins well before the volume appears, so appointment to the position of lead editor generally occurred prior to the first year shown here.

      "In chemistry, aromaticity means the molecule has cyclic (ring-shaped) structures with pi bonds in resonance (those containing delocalized electrons). Aromatic rings give increased stability compared to saturated compounds having single bonds, and other geometric or connective non-cyclic arrangements with the same set of atoms. Aromatic rings are very stable and do not break apart easily. Organic compounds that are not aromatic are classified as aliphatic compounds—they might be cyclic, but only aromatic rings have enhanced stability. The term aromaticity with this meaning is historically related to the concept of having an aroma, but is a distinct property from that meaning. Since the most common aromatic compounds are derivatives of benzene (an aromatic hydrocarbon common in petroleum and its distillates), the word aromatic occasionally refers informally to benzene derivatives, and so it was first defined.\n",

      "  Using Shewanella oneidensis, a Gram-negative facultative aerobic bacteria, as their model organism, a group of scientists looked to visualize the aerotactic bands formed by aerotactic bacteria. This bacterial strain is considered pivotal for sustainable technologies because of its ability to shift electrons from an electron donor towards an electron acceptor available in the environment like solid metals. By trapping an air bubble in-between a microscope slide and cover slip with the use of a spacer, the team was able to watch how the bacteria migrated to the air pocket over time. After about 20 minutes the bacteria started to aggregate around the air bubble and form a distinct band. The bacteria move in-between the bubble and the ring, and as time passes and air is used up, the ring shrinks towards the bubble. Phase-contrast microscopy reveals a layer of bacteria piled up at the air–liquid interface and surrounded by a depletion zone after the air bubble has been used up. In the closed set up air supply is limited and used up so a layer of bacteria is unable to build. However, in an open set up with an unlimited air supply, a notable layer of bacteria continue to build at the air-liquid interface.

      "  Extensive study of the fragments, using X-rays, has revealed enough details (gears, pinions, crank) to enable researchers to build partial replicas of the original device. Engraved on the major gears are the names of the planets, which leaves little doubt as to the intended use of the mechanism. By the collapse of the Roman Empire, the know-how and science behind this piece of clockwork was lost. According to historians Bedini and Maddison, the earliest astrarium clock with an \"almost complete description and incontestable documentation\" to have survived is the astrarium completed in 1364 by Giovanni de' Dondi (1318–1388), a scholar and physician of the Middle Ages. The original clock, consisting of 107 wheels and pinions, has been lost, perhaps during the sacking of Mantua in 1630, but de' Dondi left detailed descriptions, which have survived, enabling a reconstruction of the clock. It displays the mean time, sidereal (or star) time and the motions of the Sun, Moon and the five then-known planets Venus, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Jupiter. It was conceived according to a Ptolemaic conception of the Solar System. De' Dondi was inspired by his father Jacopo who designed the astronomical clock in the Piazzi dei Signori, Padua, in 1344 – one of the first of its type. In later ages, more astraria were built. A famous example is the Eise Eisinga Planetarium, built in 1774 by Eise Eisinga from Dronrijp, Friesland, the Netherlands. It displayed all the planets and was fixed to the ceiling in a house in Franeker, where it can still be visited. In modern times, the astrarium has grown into a tourist attraction as a commercially exploited planetarium-showing in IMAX theaters, with such presentations as The History of the Universe, as well as other astronomical phenomena.

Amorphus globosus is more common in livestock than generally assumed. It occurs most commonly in cattle, but there are also case reports in goats and horses. A case of Amorphus globosus has also been described in human medicine, where it was also a twin pregnancy M. Hishinuma, Y. Takahashi, H.

      "  His undergraduate degree, at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, was interrupted by the Second World War. He was assigned to war service at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and at the Telecommunications Research Establishment where he worked with Martin Ryle. Returning to the University of Cambridge in 1946, Hewish completed his undergraduate degree and became a postgraduate student in Ryle's research team at the Cavendish Laboratory. For his PhD thesis, awarded in 1952, Hewish made practical and theoretical advances in the observation and exploitation of the scintillations of astronomical radio sources, due to foreground plasma. Hewish proposed the construction of a large phased array radio telescope, which could be used to perform a survey at high time resolution, primarily for studying interplanetary scintillation. In 1965 he secured funding to construct his design, the Interplanetary Scintillation Array, at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO) outside Cambridge. It was completed in 1967. One of Hewish's PhD students, Jocelyn Bell (later known as Jocelyn Bell Burnell), helped to build the array and was assigned to analyse its output. Bell soon discovered a radio source which was ultimately recognised as the first pulsar. Hewish initially thought that the signal might be radio frequency interference, but it remained at a constant right ascension, which is unlikely for a terrestrial source. The scientific paper announcing the discovery had five authors, Hewish's name being listed first, Bell's second. Hewish and Ryle were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974 for work on the development of radio aperture synthesis and for Hewish's decisive role in the discovery of pulsars. The exclusion of Bell from the Nobel prize was controversial (see Nobel prize controversies). Fellow Cambridge astronomer Fred Hoyle argued that Bell should have received a share of the prize, although Bell herself stated \"it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them\". while Michael Rowan-Robinson later wrote that \"Hewish was undoubtedly the major player in the work that led to the discovery, inventing the scintillation technique in 1952, leading the team that built the array and made the discovery, and providing the interpretation\". Hewish was professor of radio astronomy in the Cavendish Laboratory from 1971 to 1989 and head of the MRAO from 1982 to 1988. He developed an association with the Royal Institution in London when it was directed by Sir Lawrence Bragg. In 1965 he was invited to co-deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on \"Exploration of the Universe\". He subsequently gave several Friday Evening Discourses and was made a Professor of the Royal Institution in 1977. Hewish was a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. He was also a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering. Hewish had honorary degrees from six universities, including Manchester, Exeter and Cambridge, was a foreign member of the Belgian Royal Academy, American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy. The National Portrait Gallery holds multiple portraits of him in its permanent collection. Other awards and honours include: Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1968 Eddington Medal, Royal Astronomical Society (1969) Dellinger Gold Medal, International Union of Radio Science (1972) Albert A. Michelson Medal, Franklin Institute (1973, jointly with Jocelyn Bell Burnell) Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize (1974) Nobel Prize for Physics (jointly) (1974) Hughes Medal, Royal Society (1976) Elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 1998 Hewish married Marjorie Elizabeth Catherine Richards in 1950. They had a son, a physicist, and a daughter, a language teacher. Hewish died on 13 September 2021, aged 97. Hewish argued that religion and science are complementary. In the foreword to Questions of Truth, Hewish writes, \"The ghostly presence of virtual particles defies rational common sense and is non-intuitive for those unacquainted with physics. Religious belief in God, and Christian belief ... may seem strange to common-sense thinking. But when the most elementary physical things behave in this way, we should be prepared to accept that the deepest aspects of our existence go beyond our common-sense understanding.\" List of astronomers Bell, Susan Jocelyn (1968).

      "  It was produced starting in 1947 by an electronic simulation of a roulette wheel attached to a computer, the results of which were then carefully filtered and tested before being used to generate the table. The RAND table was an important breakthrough in delivering random numbers, because such a large and carefully prepared table had never before been available. In addition to being available in book form, one could also order the digits on a series of punched cards. The table is formatted as 400 pages, each containing 50 lines of 50 digits. Columns and lines are grouped in fives, and the lines are numbered 00000 through 19999. The standard normal deviates are another 200 pages (10 per line, lines 0000 through 9999), with each deviate given to three decimal places. There are 28 additional pages of front matter. The main use of the tables was in statistics and the experimental design of scientific experiments, especially those that used the Monte Carlo method; in cryptography, they have also been used as nothing up my sleeve numbers, for example in the design of the Khafre cipher. The book was one of the last of a series of random number tables produced from the mid-1920s to the 1950s, after which the development of high-speed computers allowed faster operation through the generation of pseudorandom numbers rather than reading them from tables.

The film was directed by Stephanie Welch and distributed exclusively by Bullfrog Films. A Dangerous Idea claims that contemporary genetics is a resurgence of eugenics, and that the concept of the \"gene\" will eventually be regarded in the same unfavorable light as concepts such as \"royal blood\". The film further states that genetic research has been, and still is, misused by powerful groups to justify their mistreatment of the least fortunate, and to resist progress in racial and gender equality.

The museum's collection is built around fossils recovered from the nearby phosphate mine owned since 1995 by PotashCorp, but also includes fossil specimens donated from around the world as well as geology and meteorite displays. Fossils from the local mine are approximately 18-22 and 2.5-5 million years old coming from layers in the mine traced to the early Miocene and Pliocene eras in the Pungo River and Yorktown formations. The museum also maintains 2 spoils piles in the park across the street from the museum. The pits are filled with mine tailings where small shell, coral, shark tooth and other fossils are relatively easy to find. The pits are open during daylight hours daily. The museum provides information about the geological history of the Aurora area, which is known as a center for fossil hunting (especially due to the phosphate mine). The museum was founded in 1976 and opened in 1978 as a collaboration between the town of Aurora, local mines, East Carolina University, and other interested parties. Visitors are allowed to collect fossils from the neighboring spoils pile. The museum has hosted a yearly Fossil Festival each May since 1983. The festival includes a fossil auction. \"Acknowledgments\". Aurora Fossil Museum. Archived from the original on 2013-12-30. \"Chipping Away at Fossils\" (PDF).

The museum's collection is built around fossils recovered from the nearby phosphate mine owned since 1995 by PotashCorp, but also includes fossil specimens donated from around the world as well as geology and meteorite displays. Fossils from the local mine are approximately 18-22 and 2.5-5 million years old coming from layers in the mine traced to the early Miocene and Pliocene eras in the Pungo River and Yorktown formations. The museum also maintains 2 spoils piles in the park across the street from the museum. The pits are filled with mine tailings where small shell, coral, shark tooth and other fossils are relatively easy to find.\n",

      "  Students holding a category A scholarship get 1000 euro per month during the whole 24-month period of their master studies. Additionally 4000 euro is given in the beginning of every academic year. So in total a category A scholarship amounts to 32,000 euro excluding tuition and insurance fees. Students don't need to pay tuition fees in any of the partner universities and they also get an international health and travel insurance valid for two years. Including the tuition and insurance fees this particular scholarship would amount to almost 48,000 euro in two years. On the other hand, category B scholarship holding European students get 500 euro per month during the whole period. Usually they don't get the travel allowance although one can get an allowance of 3000 euro if he or she spends more than 3 months in the University of Belgrade. On the contrary if any student, holding a category A scholarship, spends more than 3 months in Belgrade, which was unusual, he/she was not paid for the months in excess of three. This system had been devised especially to encourage European students to go to third countries and third country students to visit Western European universities. Scholarships for scholars are also available in Astromundus. These are short term scholarships awarded for teaching or research for a maximum period of three months University of Innsbruck was the coordinating university of this programme. So prospective students need to send their application package there. First semester of the programme was also held at this university. So all the students come here for the first semester which usually starts during winter. Innsbruck offer introductory graduate courses on various fields of Physics, Mathematics and Astrophysics so that students from different background can come to an equal standard and be ready for the next semesters. Courses offered by the University of Innsbruck are: Advanced Mathematical Methods for Astrophysicists, Concepts of Physics for Astrophysicists, Concepts of Galactic Astrophysics, Concepts of Extragalactic Astrophysics, Introduction to Radio Astronomy, Galaxy Groups, Basic Concepts of Astro- and Particle Physics, Astrophysics Laboratory etc. Among these first four courses are compulsory. Each of the compulsory courses carry six credits. In total a student need to cover 30 credits in one semester of Astromundus. University of Padova was one of the oldest universities in Italy. It hosts two (second and final) of the four semesters of Astromundus. University of Rome Tor Vergata was the second public university of Rome and hosts all of the last three semesters of Astromundus. A student can spend 3 semesters here but it was encouraged to change institutions. More specialized courses are offered here. Such as, Extragalactic Astrophysics 1, Relativity and Cosmology, Stellar Astrophysics, Experimental Solar Physics, Extragalactic Astrophysics 2 (Observational cosmology and Galaxy clusters), Space Physics, Planetology, Astrobiology, Physics of Gravitation Radiative Processes in Astrophysics etc. Jonathan Lunine, a planetary scientist and physicist from the United States, was currently working here as a visiting professor who offers lectures in Planetology. For the last two semesters students can go to the University of Goettingen. It was ranked 4th in Germany, 30th in Europe and 93rd in the world in 2010 by the Academic Ranking of World Universities. So far it seems to be the top priority of the students for doing a master thesis. Courses offered here are mainly on stellar structure and evolution, stellar atmospheres, stellar atmospheres modelling, active galactic nuclei, numerical experiments in astrophysics, cosmological structure formation, inflationary theory, helioseismology, physics of Sun. They also offer some seminar courses related to string theory and supermassive black holes that one can take for credits. University of Belgrade was situated in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Students can go there for the last two semesters. The best master theses written by Astromundus students will be considered for publication in the Serbian Astronomical Journal published by the Astronomical Observatory Belgrade and the Department of Astronomy, Belgrade. A student typically needs to go to more than two universities in two years. Thus he/she encounters different environments, different examination and grading systems. Like in Innsbruck, in accordance with the Austrian system, exams are usually in written form and grades are given on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being excellent and 5 being insufficient and grades have to be an integer number. In Italy however exams are usually oral (typically 40 minutes to one hour, sometimes even longer) and grades range from 0 to 30, 17 being fail and 30 being the highest score. They also have a grade named 30 LODE (or 30+) awarded for exceptionally good performances. In Germany, exams are again oral (lasting for 15 to 30 minutes) and grading system was somewhat similar to Austria\n",

      "Accessory gene regulator (agr) is a complex 5 gene locus that is a global regulator of virulence in Staphylococcus aureus. It encodes a two-component transcriptional quorum-sensing (QS) system activated by an autoinducing, thiolactone-containing cyclic peptide (AIP). Agr occurs in 4 allelic subtypes that have an important role in staphylococcal evolution. The corresponding AIPs are mutually cross-inhibitory, which may enhance the evolutionary separation of the 4 groups. The agr receptor, AgrC, is a model histidine phosphokinase (HPK) that has been used to decipher the molecular mechanism of signal transduction. AIP binding to the extracellular domain of AgrC causes twisting of the intracellular a-helical domain so as to enable trans-phosphorylation of the active site histidine;  the inhibitory AIPs cause the α-helical domain to twist in the opposite direction, preventing trans-phosphorylation.\n",

      "original_text:\n",
      "  Albert lamented the loss of indigenous fauna species brought about by the destruction of their natural habitat, and the breakdown of local natural ecosystems and their beauty. He looked for ways to manage these issues. Several failures at establishing a barrier to the wind blown sand deposits in his exposed garden inspired Morris to search for plants that could be grown in the prevailing tough arid conditions, and which would control erosion by binding the exposed soils. He and Margaret began to acquire expertise with botanical taxonomy and systematics, and by the mid 1920s Albert was corresponding with other Australian botanists. He established a home nursery, purchasing adjoining land and expanding his garden. In 1920, along with Margaret Morris and W.D.K. McGillivray (1868-1933), a local doctor and also a prominent Australian ornithologist and natural scientist, Albert helped establish the Broken Hill based Barrier Field Naturalists Club, serving as its secretary until his death in 1939. Margaret also served on the executive of the club. Members were interested in natural sciences such as botany and geology, and also history, conducting regular field trips and lecture series. Albert and Margaret were prominent members, participating in field trips to the country around Broken Hill, studying and collecting specimens of the indigenous flora and observing the local ecosystems. As well as Margaret's diverse contributions, it is important to note that throughout the 1920s and 1930s Albert's botanical, conservation, tree plantation and regeneration work were strongly stimulated and supported by the many talented members of the Field Naturalists Club, people such as Dr. William MacGillivray, his son Dr. Ian MacGillivray, Edmund Dow, Maurice Mawby and many others. Morris became widely recognised for his botanical expertise, urban tree plantation work, his propagation and contributions of plants to residents and civic bodies in Broken Hill, and for his firm belief in the possibility of revegetating the barren city landscapes. University of Adelaide botanist and plant ecologist Professor T G Osborn had been concerned about the degradation of South Australia's arid-zone flora, and the resultant wind erosion, since approximately 1920. At the university's Koonamore research facility, Yunta, he studied the capacity of the flora to naturally regenerate under stock exclosure conditions. Osborn concluded that overstocking on pastoral stations was the primary cause of the vegetation degradation, and that natural regeneration of the flora was possible. He advised pastoralists to carefully manage station stocking levels, and to preserve the indigenous vegetation. South Australian pastoralists heeded Osborn's research work and advice. From approximately 1930, pastoralists developed \"'flora reserves\", which were fenced areas that excluded stock and allowed natural regeneration of the indigenous flora. The largest known flora reserve was approximately four hectares (ten acres). Other pastoralists undertook furrowing projects (a form of ploughing), a practice that facilitated the natural regeneration of the flora. Many of these projects were highly successful, and degraded, wind eroded soil-drifts and scalds (areas of eroded, hardened, water impervious soil) were revegetated and stabilised. Albert Morris was certainly aware of Professor Osborn's Koonamore research work by 1928, as the research was well publicised and Morris had engaged in botanical correspondence with Osborn. Quite possibly Morris visited the Koonamore research facility, as it was located only approximately 250 kilometres from Broken Hill. The restoration work of South Australian pastoralists also received some newspaper publicity, so it is quite possible that Morris's thinking on the restoration of degraded indigenous flora was influenced by the stock exclosure and natural regeneration research and projects conducted in South Australia. Morris achieved national and international recognition as an expert on arid-zone Australian flora, and corresponded with many prominent Australian botanists. He, with Margaret, made a collection of about 8000 plant specimens, the bulk of which were donated to the Waite Institute in South Australia in 1944. This collection is now predominantly held by the State Herbarium of South Australia with some specimens held by other state collections, including the Royal Botanic Garden of NSW. He and Margaret were noted for their generosity and hospitality to fellow naturalists and others working at Broken Hill. Among those they befriended was the noted botanist and author Thistle Harris, who worked in Broken Hill as a teacher c.1930. By 1936 Albert Morris had acquired considerable expertise in the distinct fields of arid-zone tree plantation establishment, and arid-zone natural regeneration. His expertise in natural regeneration was based on the field knowledge that he had acquired on Barrier Field Naturalists Club outings into the surrounding countryside, and his deep botanical knowledge of arid-zone flora species. His own home nursery experiments with sand stabilising plants such as Atriplex spp. saltbushes, further enhanced his regeneration and restoration knowledge. Quite possibly the natural regeneration work of Professor Osborn and the South Australian pastoralists had influenced him. Broad acreage furrowing field trials, conducted in 1935-36 by Morris with local pastoralists on their pastoral stations, facilitated natural regeneration of the indigenous flora and must also have convinced him of the efficacy of natural regeneration as a means of restoring degraded lands\n",

      "original_text:\n",
      "  The reason is that the ribosome only sees the anticodon of the tRNA during translation. Thus, the ribosome will not be able to discriminate between tRNAs with the same anticodon but linked to different amino acids. By attaching the correct amino acid to its associated tRNA molecule, activation ensures both specificity and fidelity of translation. Editing mechanisms occur when there is a misactivation of amino acids, where an amino acid is attached to the wrong tRNA molecule. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase can hydrolyze the amino acid before it attaches to the wrong tRNA molecule (pre-transfer editing) or deacylate the mischarged tRNA after attachment (post-transfer editing). The error frequency of the amino acid activation reaction is approximately 1 in 10,000 despite the small structural differences between some of the amino acids. Amino acid activation was first characterized by Mahlon Hoagland, who found that amino acids could be activated by certain enzymes to form an aminoacyl adenylate intermediate compound. The enzymes were discovered to be aminoacyl t-RNA synthetases, responsible for catalyzing the linkage of an amino acid to a small RNA molecule. Hoagland and his collaborator, Paul Zamecnik, later discovered that the small RNA molecule was a tRNA, and they identified it as a key facilitator of translation. Amino acid activation is a key reaction in many biochemical and metabolic processes. In particular, leucine natural killer treatment of interleukin-18 activated cells triggers the mTORC1 metabolic sensor, which indicates that mTORC1 causes amino acid-driven activation due to a high expression in amino acid transporters. The Inhibition of CD98/LAT1 amino acid transporters abroad mTORC1 activation driven by leucine, decreased the activity of the NK cell-effector.

      " Thus, the ribosome will not be able to discriminate between tRNAs with the same anticodon but linked to different amino acids. By attaching the correct amino acid to its associated tRNA molecule, activation ensures both specificity and fidelity of translation. Editing mechanisms occur when there is a misactivation of amino acids, where an amino acid is attached to the wrong tRNA molecule. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase can hydrolyze the amino acid before it attaches to the wrong tRNA molecule (pre-transfer editing) or deacylate the mischarged tRNA after attachment (post-transfer editing) The error frequency of the amino acid activation reaction is approximately 1 in 10,000 despite the small structural differences between some of the amino acids. Amino acid activation was first characterized by Mahlon Hoagland, who found that amino acids could be activated by certain enzymes to form an aminoacyl adenylate intermediate compound.\n",

      " Jonckheere took a first class degree in psychology with statistics in 1949 and a PhD in 1956, both from UCL. Jonckheere is probably best known for his work in nonparametric statistics, approaches which make fewer assumptions about the theoretical distribution of the data than parametric statistics. In this field he developed what is now known as Jonckheere's trend test, a method which is implemented in SPSS, a statistical package favoured by social scientists, and R, widely used by statisticians. He published little; however, he influenced many people's ideas and work, with traces of conversations and advice throughout UCL and beyond Jonckheere visited and left his mark at the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva, where Jean Piaget forbade him from leaving unless he could find an equally able replacement.\n",

      "  It includes metal salts which are important for processes requiring ions such as Na+ (Sodium), K+ (Potassium), and Ca2+ (Calcium). It also includes trace minerals which are required for unique molecules, such as chlorophyll and hemoglobin. Procedures for ash content determination are similar to procedures for Loss on ignition. Typically, the term ash is used for primarily organic material such as fuels and foodstuffs, while the term loss on ignition is used for primarily inorganic material such as rocks and combusted ash. A crucible can be used to determine the percentage of ash contained in a sample of material such as coal, wood, oil, rubber, plastics, foodstuffs, or any burnable material. The appropriate method for ash determination varies depending upon the type of sample analyzed. Each method may vary in parameters such as furnace temperature, residence time in the furnace, number of heating steps, and sample preparation procedures. The ISO mandates ash content determination for most foodstuffs. Examples include ISO 2171: Cereals, pulses and by-products — Determination of ash yield by incineration; ISO 3593: Starch — Determination of ash; ISO 928: Spices and condiments - Determination of total ash; and ISO 936: Meat and meat products - Determination of total ash. Examples of ash content methods for the determination of ash in other solids include ASTM D482: Standard Test Method for Ash from Petroleum Products; ISO 6245: Petroleum products — Determination of ash; ASTM D874: Standard Test Method for Sulfated Ash from Lubricating Oils and Additives; ASTM D3174: Standard Test Method for Ash in the Analysis Sample of Coal and Coke from Coal; ISO 1171: Solid mineral fuels — Determination of ash; ISO 18122: Solid biofuels — Determination of ash content; ASTM D1102: Standard Test Method for Ash in Wood; ASTM D2974: Standard Test Methods for Determining the Water (Moisture) Content, Ash Content, and Organic Material of Peat and Other Organic Soils; ASTM D2866: Standard Test Method for Total Ash Content of Activated Carbon; ISO 3451: Plastics — Determination of ash — Part 1: General methods; ASTM D2584: Standard Test Method for Ignition Loss of Cured Reinforced Resins; and ASTM D5630: Standard Test Method for Ash Content in Plastics. In the ash analysis of petroleum products, ash content represents the incombustible component remaining after a sample of the furnace oil is completely burned. The ash content of petroleum products is generally low. It is defined as the inorganic residue that remains after combustion of the oil in air at specific high temperature. Ash typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.2% in oil. Some of the ash forming constituents occur naturally in crude oil; others are present as a result of refining or contamination during storage or distribution. Knowledge of the amount of ash-forming material present in a product can provide information as to whether or not the product is suitable application. In the ash analysis of coal and other solid fuels, the amount of sulfur retained in the ash during the ashing process is not constant, but rather is dependent upon the conditions of ashing as well as the other inorganic constituents in the ash that may form sulfates during the ashing procedure. As such, different ashing procedures may yield different ash contents. Some necessary apparatus include: crucible (or similar porcelain or metal dishes) muffled furnace hot plate the sample A crucible and its lid are pre-weighed after thorough drying. The sample is added to the completely dry crucible and lid and together they are weighed to determine the mass of the sample by difference. The sample is placed in the hot furnace long enough so that complete combustion of the sample occurs. The crucible, lid and ash then are re-weighed. The analysis of honey shows: Typical honey analysis Fructose: 38% Glucose: 31% Sucrose: 1% Water: 17% Other sugars: 9% (maltose, melezitose) Ash: 0.17% In this example the ash would include all the minerals in honey.

      "In analytical chemistry, ashing or ash content determination is the process of mineralization for preconcentration of trace substances prior to a chemical analysis, such as chromatography, or optical analysis, such as spectroscopy. The ash content of a sample is a measure of the amount of inorganic noncombustible material it contains. The residues after a sample is completely burnt - in contrast to the ash remaining after incomplete combustion - typically consist of oxides of the inorganic elements present in the original sample. Ash is one of the components in the proximate analysis of biological materials, consisting mainly of salty, inorganic constituents. It includes metal salts which are important for processes requiring ions such as Na+ (Sodium), K+ (Potassium), and Ca2+ (Calcium).\n",

The term was used in the late 1970s and early 1980s to describe a new treatment for massive burns. It was later discovered that treatment of deep skin wounds in adult animals and humans with this scaffold induces regeneration of the dermis. It has been developed commercially under the name Integra and is used in massively burned patients, during plastic surgery of the skin, and in treatment of chronic skin wounds. Alternatively, the term \"artificial skin\" sometimes is used to refer to skin-like tissue grown in a laboratory, although this technology is still quite a way away from being viable for use in the medical field.\n",

      "  The membership expanded in 2010 with the merger with the \"Association of Clinical Microbiologists\". The broader nature of the membership contributed to the renaming of the ACB to its current name at the annual meeting in 2013. The ACB is responsible for determining the specific content for courses related to certification as a clinical biochemist in the UK. Normally this is a three or four year academic sequence followed by qualification examinations. Because of the competitive admission criteria, many applicants have advanced degrees before beginning the biochemistry program. Papers published by ACB members are related to the use of laboratories by doctors and patient health diagnostic testing in the UK. Blood draw procedures and tests by junior doctors and nurses in the A&E department of a Birmingham hospital were frequently performed with the wrong collection equipment or were mishandled afterward. The College of Emergency Medicine said the issue identified by the audit at Birmingham is \"universally relevant\". A 2008 study emphasized issues with junior doctors who were not being trained in pathology and laboratory testing. Eighteen percent of junior doctors in the sample were not confident they could interpret the results of tests they ordered for patients. More than 70% felt a need for more training in clinical biochemistry. The ACB was part of a 2008 effort by a consortium to support a Scottish government initiative aimed at emphasizing the need for quality laboratory services to the practice of medicine. \"IFCC - Full members\".

      "  The observed degeneracy boils down to the fact that the system has a D3 symmetry. In quantum mechanics, calculations (at least formally) boil down to the diagonalization of Hermitian matrices - in particular, the Hamiltonian, or in the continuous case, the solution of linear differential equations. Again, observed degeneracies in the eigenspectrum are a consequence of discrete (or continuous) symmetries. In the latter case, Noether's theorem also guarantees a conserved current. \"Accidental\" symmetry is the name given to observed degeneracies that are apparently not a consequence of symmetry. The term is misleading as often the observed degeneracy is not accidental at all, and is a consequence of a 'hidden' symmetry which is not immediately obvious from the Hamiltonian in a given basis. The non relativistic Hydrogen atoms a good example of this - by construction, its Hamiltonian is invariant under the full rotation group in 3 dimensions, SO(3). A less obvious feature is that the Hamiltonian is also invariant under SO(4), the extension of SO(3) to 4D, of which SO(3) is a subgroup (another way of saying this is that all possible rotations in 3D are also possible in 4D - we just don't rotate about the additional axis). This gives rise to the 'accidental' degeneracy observed in the Hydrogenic eigenspectrum. As a more palatable example, consider the Hermitian matrix: [ 0 − 0.5 − 0.5 0.5 − 0.5 − 2 0 0 − 0.5 0 0 0 0.5 0 0 2 ] {\\displaystyle {\\begin{bmatrix}0&-0.5&-{\\sqrt {0.5}}&0.5\\\\-0.5&-{\\sqrt {2}}&0&0\\\\-{\\sqrt {0.5}}&0&0&0\\\\0.5&0&0&{\\sqrt {2}}\\\\\\end{bmatrix}}} Although there is already some suggestive relationships between the matrix elements, it is not clear what the symmetry of this matrix is at first glance. However, it is easy to demonstrate that by a unitary transformation, this matrix is equivalent to: [ 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 ] {\\displaystyle {\\begin{bmatrix}0&1&0&0\\\\1&0&1&0\\\\0&1&0&1\\\\0&0&1&0\\\\\\end{bmatrix}}} Which can be verified directly by numerically (or for purists, analytically - see Chebyshev polynomials for some clues) diagonalising the sub-matrix formed by removing the first row and column. Rotating the basis defining this sub matrix using the resulting unitary brings the original matrix into the originally stated form. This matrix has a P4 permutation symmetry, which in this basis is much easier to see, and could constitute a 'hidden' symmetry. In this case, there are no degeneracies in the eigenspectrum. The technical reason for this is that each eigenstate transforms with respect to a different irreducible representation of P4. If one encountered a case where some group of eigenstates correspond to the same irreducible representation of the 'hidden' symmetry group, a degeneracy would be observed. Although for this simple 4x4 matrix the symmetry could have been guessed (it was after all, always there to begin with), if the matrix was larger, it would have been more difficult to spot.

      "original_text:\n",
      "  In Medieval Europe the word Astronomia was often used to encompass both disciplines as this included the study of astronomy and astrology jointly and without a real distinction; this was one of the original Seven Liberal Arts. Kings and other rulers generally employed court astrologers to aid them in the decision making in their kingdoms, thereby funding astronomical research. University medical students were taught astrology as it was generally used in medical practice. Astronomy and astrology diverged over the course of the 17th through 19th centuries. Copernicus did not practice astrology (nor empirical astronomy; his work was theoretical), but the most important astronomers before Isaac Newton were astrologers by profession—Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei. Also relevant here was the development of better timekeeping instruments, initially for aid in navigation; improved timekeeping made it possible to make more exact astrological predictions—predictions which could be tested, and which consistently proved to be false. By the end of the 18th century, astronomy was one of the major sciences of the Enlightenment model, using the recently codified scientific method, and was altogether distinct from astrology. Astrology is considered by many philosophers and astronomers to be a false representation of the universe that individuals may use to associate the movement of the celestial bodies to their own ideas of human life and spirituality. Although many scholars consider astrology to be a pseudoscience, those that believe in zodiac signs and their meanings will argue the opposite, and these followers will support their claims with explanations for how and why the universe is connected to the human condition. The most popular and well-known form of astrology is seen in horoscopes that people are exposed to through social media, popular news outlets, and digital media. The horoscopes allow people interested in astrology and zodiac signs to associate planets like Mars to human emotions such as drive and courage, and further increase the notion that these planets and their motions have an effect on their daily lives. Although astrology was considered factual predictions in ancient science, in modern times it is used as a spiritual belief system for many people. Ancient forms of astrology often combined with astronomy, but eventually split into separate paths during the time of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. Zodiac signs in modern times are constructed from constellations seen across the earth, and they are used to associate human emotions and tendencies with the stars and heavenly bodies. In some ways, astrology has become somewhat of a pseudo-religion, due to the emphasis put on the meanings of constellations and how they relate to each individual. One may “judge” another person based on their zodiac sign, simply because there are unique listed traits carried by each sign, which reflect on the person who it refers to. The signs that are attributed to individuals are based on the time of year that each individual was born in. For example, people born between April 19 and May 4th will carry the zodiac sign of Aries, and those born between July 21 and August 10th carry the Cancer sign. Despite the many individuals that consider zodiac astrology to be factual, many consider the horoscope meanings to be false and simply participate in this modern astrology for enjoyment. Lastly, zodiac signs and astrology in the modern era are very different from the astrology of the ancient world. The minimal technology, knowledge, and expertise of the ancient world allowed for the combination of astrology and astronomy to become the generally accepted explanation for the universe and its impact on human lives. Whereas in current times, astrology and astronomy are extremely different. Zodiac signs and horoscopes are a product of cultural developments (such as the internet) that allow for easy access to information on the horoscopes through social media, tabloids and news outlets that benefit from promoting these aspects of astrology. Many individuals that are interested in horoscopes are not aware that the signs and their respective dates are inaccurate, and do not have any basis in science. Due to the “trendy” nature of zodiac signs and their popularity, it is widely recognized as part of global culture.

      " Not until the time of Francis Bacon was astrology rejected as a part of scholastic metaphysics rather than empirical observation. A more definitive split between astrology and astronomy in the West took place gradually in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when astrology was increasingly thought of as an occult science or superstition by the intellectual elite. Because of their lengthy shared history, it sometimes happens that the two are confused with one another even today. Many contemporary astrologers, however, do not claim that astrology is a science, but think of it as a form of divination like the I-Ching, an art, or a part of a spiritual belief structure (influenced by trends such as Neoplatonism, Neopaganism, Theosophy, and Hinduism)[citation needed] The primary goal of astronomy is to understand the physics of the universe.\n",

      "  The impulses externally on the fibre were uniform: \"as simple as the dots in Morse code\". Stimulus strength was manipulated and the resulting frequency measured, yielding a relationship where f∝sn[further explanation needed]. The magnitude of the action potential set up in any single nerve fibre is independent of the strength of the exciting stimulus, provided the latter is adequate. An electrical stimulus below threshold strength fails to elicit a propagated spike potential. If it is of threshold strength or over, a spike (a nervous impulse) of maximum magnitude is set up. Either the single fibre does not respond with spike production, or it responds to the utmost of its ability under the conditions at the moment. This property of the single nerve fibre is termed the all-or-none relationship. This relationship holds only for the unit of tissue; for nervous tissue the unit is the nerve cell, for skeletal muscle the unit is the individual muscle fiber and for the heart the unit is the entire auricles or the entire ventricles. Stimuli too weak to produce a spike do, however, set up a local electrotonus, the magnitude of the electronic potential progressively increasing with the strength of the stimulus, until a spike is generated. This demonstrates the all-or-none relationship in spike production. The above account deals with the response of a single nerve fibre. If a nerve trunk is stimulated, then as the exciting stimulus is progressively increased above a threshold, a larger number of fibres respond. The minimal effective (i.e., threshold) stimulus is adequate only for fibres of high excitability, but a stronger stimulus excites all the nerve fibres. Increasing the stimulus further does increase the response of whole nerve. Heart muscle is excitable, i.e., it responds to external stimuli by contracting. If the external stimulus is too weak, no response is obtained; if the stimulus is adequate, the heart responds to the best of its ability. Accordingly, the auricles or ventricles behave as a single unit, so that an adequate stimulus normally produces a full contraction of either the auricles or ventricles. The force of the contraction obtained depends on the state in which the muscles fibres find themselves. In the case of muscle fibres, the individual muscle fibre does not respond at all if the stimulus is too weak. However, it responds maximally when the stimulus rises to threshold. The contraction is not increased if the stimulus strength is further raised. Stronger stimuli bring more muscle fibres into action and thus the tension of a muscle increases as the strength of the stimulus applied to it rises.

The moral and ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century. There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species.

      " Data collected between 1992 and 2010 demonstrates that the region is uplifting at a rate of ~10 mm/year and subsiding at a slower rate (only a few mm/year). More recent InSAR data, collected between September 2014 and December 2017, shows that the uplift rate over this time period has decreased to 3-5 mm/year and may experience short-term velocity reversals. Additionally, there is evidence that the uplift and subsidence rates have balanced out over the past 16,000 years to create no net deformation. These aspects of the uplift and subsidence cannot be easily explained by the diapir model, so other possible mechanisms for driving the deformation are being investigated One such mechanism that might explain the deformation is the movement of volatiles in a column connected to the APMB.\n",

      " Aposematism is the advertising by an animal to potential predators that it is not worth attacking or eating. This unprofitability may consist of any defenses which make the prey difficult to kill and eat, such as toxicity, venom, foul taste or smell, sharp spines, or aggressive nature. These advertising signals may take the form of conspicuous coloration, sounds, odours, or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm. The term was coined in 1877 by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. Aposematism is exploited in Müllerian mimicry, where species with strong defences evolve to resemble one another. By mimicking similarly coloured species, the warning signal to predators is shared, causing them to learn more quickly at less of a cost. A genuine aposematic signal that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences is not the only way to deter predators. In Batesian mimicry, a mimicking species resembles an aposematic model closely enough to share the protection, while many species have bluffing deimatic displays which may startle a predator long enough to enable an otherwise undefended prey to escape. There is good evidence for aposematism in terrestrial animals; its existence in marine animals is possible but disputed. The term aposematism was coined by the English zoologist Edward Bagnall Poulton in his 1890 book The Colours of Animals. He based the term on the Ancient Greek words ἀπό apo 'away' and σῆμα sēma 'sign', referring to signs that warn other animals away. The function of aposematism is to prevent attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defenses such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defense mechanism, and the non-visible defenses are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colors and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. This is in contrast to deimatic displays, which attempt to startle a predator with a threatening appearance but which are bluffing, unsupported by any strong defences. The most common and effective colors are red, yellow, black, and white. These colors provide strong contrast with green foliage, resist changes in shadow and lighting, are highly chromatic, and provide distance dependent camouflage. Some forms of warning coloration provide this distance dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and color combination that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance, but are warning-like from a close proximity, allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism. Warning coloration evolves in response to background, light conditions, and predator vision. Visible signals may be accompanied by odors, sounds or behavior to provide a multi-modal signal which is more effectively detected by predators. Unpalatability, broadly understood, can be created in a variety of ways. Some insects such as the ladybird or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odor, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colors and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers. Aposematism is widespread in insects, but less so in vertebrates, being mostly confined to a smaller number of reptile, amphibian, and fish species, and some foul-smelling or aggressive mammals. Pitohuis, red and black birds whose toxic feathers and skin apparently comes from the poisonous beetles they ingest, could be included. It has been proposed that aposematism played a role in human evolution, body odour carrying a warning to predators of large hominins able to defend themselves with weapons. Perhaps the most numerous aposematic vertebrates are the poison dart frogs (family: Dendrobatidae). These neotropical anuran amphibians exhibit a wide spectrum of coloration and toxicity. Some species in this poison frog family (particularly Dendrobates, Epipedobates, and Phyllobates) are conspicuously coloured and sequester one of the most toxic alkaloids among all living species. Within the same family, there are also cryptic frogs (such as Colostethus and Mannophryne) that lack these toxic alkaloids. Although these frogs display an extensive array of coloration and toxicity, there is very little genetic difference between the species. Evolution of their conspicuous coloration is correlated to traits such as chemical defense, dietary specialization, acoustic diversification, and increased body mass. Some plants are thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of unpalatable chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as cinnabar moth caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants. Among mammals, skunks and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black-and-white patterns on their fur, while the similarly-patterned badger and honey badger advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures\n",

      " The Astroscan was a wide-field 4⅛\" clear-inch (105mm) diameter reflecting telescope, originally produced by the Edmund Scientific Corporation, that was for sale from 1976 to 2013. The Astroscan had a Newtonian reflector layout with a 4⅛\" clear-inch (105mm) diameter f/4.2 aluminized and overcoated borosilicate glass parabolic primary mirror with a focal length of 17½ inches (445mm). The telescope's secondary mirror was mounted on a flat optical window at the front of the tube. Edmund designer Norman Sperling and optical engineer Mike Simmons came up with the basic design and Peter Bressler Design Associates did the detailed work on this simple introductory telescope. Rather than using a more traditional equatorial or altazimuth mount the Astroscan features a spherical housing around the primary reflector which sat in a cast aluminum cradle. The design was durable and allowed for simple operation by novice amateur astronomers; it won an Industrial Design Award in 1976. The telescope body was made from high impact acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic and was equipped with a carrying strap to aid portability. Because it was targeted at the novice market the telescope had its limitations: The general design was for low power hand-held or wide-angle work, the short f/4 focal ratio did not allow for high magnification without the image degrading, and the primary mirror was factory aligned with no provisions for adjustment. The Astroscan came with 15 mm and 28 mm focal length RKE eyepieces, giving it a magnification of 30X and 16X respectively, with a 3.0° field of view using the 28 mm eyepiece, and a 1.6° with the 15 mm. When Edmund Scientific introduced the telescope in 1976 they called it \"The Edmund Wide-Field Telescope\" with a Part Number \"2001\" Edmund had a public contest which ran until November 15, 1976, to come up with a name. The winning name was \"Astroscan 2001\". The \"2001\" part of the name was dropped over time. The Astroscan continued to be available after Edmund Scientific was acquired by Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories in 2001 with the telescope for sale on the \"Edmund Scientific\" website. Production and sales of the telescope ceased in 2013 when the mold for the plastic body broke. In 2016 the Edmund Scientific website, now called Scientifics Direct, began offering a more common format altitude-azimuth mounted 4.5 inch table-top Newtonian telescope labeled the \"Astroscan Millennium\". There are reports of a Kickstarter campaign by one of the original Astroscan creators to fund production of a new version based on the original Astroscan telescope. Scientifics Direct expected to have the Astroscan back in production in early 2017. Scientifics Direct's website stated they would reintroduce the original Astroscan design in late 2020. At this time the production of the Original Astroscan will be placed on hold until the quality and price point can be comparable to the original.

      " The automatic calculation of particle interaction or decay is part of the computational particle physics branch. It refers to computing tools that help calculating the complex particle interactions as studied in high-energy physics, astroparticle physics and cosmology. The goal of the automation is to handle the full sequence of calculations in an automatic (programmed) way: from the Lagrangian expression describing the physics model up to the cross-sections values and to the event generator software. Particle accelerators or colliders produce collisions (interactions) of particles (like the electron or the proton). The colliding particles form the Initial State. In the collision, particles can be annihilated or/and exchanged producing possibly different sets of particles, the Final States. The Initial and Final States of the interaction relate through the so-called scattering matrix (S-matrix). For example, at LEP, e+ + e− → e+ + e− , or e+ + e− → μ+ + μ− are processes where the initial state is an electron and a positron colliding to produce an electron and a positron or two muons of opposite charge: the final states. In these simple cases, no automatic packages are needed and cross-section analytical expressions can be easily derived at least for the lowest approximation: the Born approximation also called the leading order or the tree level (as Feynman diagrams have only trunk and branches, no loops). But particle physics is now requiring much more complex calculations like at LHC p p → n jets {\\displaystyle pp\\rightarrow n_{\\text{jets}}} where p {\\displaystyle p} are protons and n jets {\\displaystyle n_{\\text{jets}}} is the number of jets of particles initiated by proton constituents (quarks and gluons). The number of subprocesses describing a given process is so large that automatic tools have been developed to mitigate the burden of hand calculations. Interactions at higher energies open a large spectrum of possible final states and consequently increase the number of processes to compute. High precision experiments impose the calculation of higher order calculation, namely the inclusion of subprocesses where more than one virtual particle can be created and annihilated during the interaction lapse creating so-called loops which induce much more involved calculations. Finally new theoretical models like the supersymmetry model (MSSM in its minimal version) predict a flurry of new processes. The automatic packages, once seen as mere teaching support, have become, this last 10 years an essential component of the data simulation and analysis suite for all experiments. They help constructing event generators and are sometimes viewed as generators of event generators or Meta-generators. A particle physics model is essentially described by its Lagrangian. To simulate the production of events through event generators, 3 steps have to be taken. The Automatic Calculation project is to create the tools to make those steps as automatic (or programmed) as possible: I Feynman rules, coupling and mass generation LanHEP is an example of Feynman rules generation. Some model needs an additional step to compute, based on some parameters, the mass and coupling of new predicted particles. II Matrix element code generation: Various methods are used to automatically produce the matrix element expression in a computer language (Fortran, C/C++). They use values (i.e. for the masses) or expressions (i.e. for the couplings) produced by step I or model specific libraries constructed by hands (usually heavily relying on Computer algebra languages). When this expression is integrated (usually numerically) over the internal degrees of freedom it will provide the total and differential cross-sections for a given set of initial parameters like the initial state particle energies and polarization. III Event generator code generation: This code must them be interfaced to other packages to fully provide the actual final state. The various effects or phenomenon that need to be implemeted are: Initial state radiation and beamstrahlung for e+ e− initial states. Parton distribution functions describing the actual content in terms of gluons and quarks of the p or p-bar initial state particles Parton showering describing the way final state quarks or gluons due to the QCD confinement generate additional quark/gluon pairs generating a so-called shower of partons before transforming into hadrons. Hadronization describing how the final quark pairs/triplets form the visible and detectable hadrons. Underlying event takes care of the way the rest, in term of constituent, of the initial protons also contribute to any given event. The interplay or matching of the precise matrix element calculation and the approximations resulting from the simulation of the parton shower gives rise to further complications, either within a given level of precision like at leading order (LO) for the production of n jets or between two levels of precision when tempting to connect matrix element computed at next-to-leading (NLO) (1-loop) or next-to-next-leading order (NNLO) (2-loops) with LO partons shower package. Several methods have been developed for this matching, including: Subtraction methods. But the only correct way is to match packages at the same level theoretical accuracy like the NLO matrix element calculation with NLO parton shower packages. This is currently in development. The idea of automation of the calculations in high-energy physics is not new. It dates back to the 1960s when packages such as SCHOONSCHIP and then REDUCE had been developed. These are symbolic manipulation codes that automatize the algebraic parts of a matrix element evaluation, like traces on Dirac matrices and contraction of Lorentz indices. Such codes have evolved quite a lot with applications not only optimized for high-energy physics like FORM but also more general purpose programs like Mathematica and Maple\n",

The Initial and Final States of the interaction relate through the so-called scattering matrix (S-matrix).\n",

      "  Turning starch into sugar is done by the enzyme amylase. The process in which amylase breaks down starch for sugar consumption is not consistent with all organisms that use amylase to breakdown stored starch. There are different amylase pathways that are involved in starch degradation. The occurrence of starch degradation into sugar by the enzyme amylase was most commonly known to take place in the Chloroplast, but that has been proven wrong. One example is the spinach plant, in which the chloroplast contains both alpha and beta amylase (They are different versions of amylase involved in the breakdown of starch and they differ in their substrate specificity). In spinach leaves, the extrachloroplastic region contains the highest level of amylase degradation of starch. The difference between chloroplast and extrachloroplastic starch degradation is in the amylase pathway they prefer; either beta or alpha amylase. For spinach leaves, Alpha-amylase is preferred but for plants/organisms like wheat, barley, peas, etc. the Beta-amylase is preferred. The amylolytic process is used in the brewing of alcohol from grains. Since grains contain starches but little to no simple sugars, the sugar needed to produce alcohol is derived from starch via the amylolytic process. In beer brewing, this is done through malting. In sake brewing, the mold Aspergillus oryzae provides amylolysis, and in Tapai, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The amylolytic process can also be used to allow for maximum results in production. For instance, glucose formation, when amylolytic enzymes are added to a given compound, the enzymes work to give maximum formation. The amylolytic process is also useful in the breaking down of molecules, it can be closely associated with the process of hydrolysis. Brewing methods Rogosa, Eli (2016).

      "  For a leasing arrangement with an initial capital cost of C, a residual value at the end of the lease of F and a monthly interest rate of r, monthly interest starts at Cr and decreases almost linearly during the term of the lease to a final value of Fr. The total amount of interest paid over the lease term of N months is therefore N ( C r + F r ) 2 , {\\displaystyle {\\frac {N(Cr+Fr)}{2}}\\,,} and the average interest amount per month is ( C + F ) r 2 . {\\displaystyle {\\frac {(C+F)r}{2}}\\,.} This amount is called the \"monthly finance fee\". The factor r/2 is called the \"money factor\" Despite repeated attempts by regulators to establish usable and consistent standards, APR does not represent the total cost of borrowing in some jurisdictions nor does it really create a comparable standard across jurisdictions. Nevertheless, it is considered a reasonable starting point for an ad hoc comparison of lenders. Credit card holders should be aware that most U.S. credit cards are quoted in terms of nominal APR compounded monthly, which is not the same as the effective annual rate (EAR). Despite the word \"annual\" in APR, it is not necessarily a direct reference for the interest rate paid on a stable balance over one year. The more direct reference for the one-year rate of interest is EAR. The general conversion factor for APR to EAR is E A R = ( 1 + A P R n ) n − 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {EAR} =(1+{\\tfrac {\\mathrm {APR} }{n}})^{n}-1} , where n represents the number of compounding periods of the APR per EAR period. As an example, for a common credit card quoted at 12.99% APR compounded monthly, the one year EAR is ( 1 + 0.129949 12 ) 12 − 1 {\\displaystyle (1+{\\tfrac {0.129949}{12}})^{12}-1} , or 13.7975%. For 12.99% APR compounded daily, the EAR paid on a stable balance over one year becomes 13.87% (where the .000049 addition to the 12.99% APR is possible because the new rate does not exceed the advertised APR[citation needed]). Note that a high U.S. APR of 29.99% compounded monthly carries an effective annual rate of 34.48%. While the difference between APR and EAR may seem trivial, because of the exponential nature of interest these small differences can have a large effect over the life of a loan. For example, consider a 30-year loan of $200,000 with a stated APR of 10.00%, i.e., 10.0049% APR or the EAR equivalent of 10.4767%. The monthly payments, using APR, would be $1755.87. However, using an EAR of 10.00% the monthly payment would be $1691.78. The difference between the EAR and APR amounts to a difference of $64\n",

Lightstone's main research contributions were in non-standard analysis. He also wrote papers on angle trisection, matrix inversion, and applications of group theory to formal logic. Lightstone was the author or co-author of several books on mathematics: The Axiomatic Method: An Introduction to Mathematical Logic (Prentice Hall, 1964). This introductory textbook is divided into two parts, one providing an informal introduction to Boolean logic and the second using formal methods to prove the consistency and completeness of the predicate calculus. It is aimed at students who already have some familiarity with abstract algebra, and one of its themes is an algebraic view of mathematical proofs in logic. Concepts of Calculus (Harper and Row, 1965). This is a textbook on the calculus of real functions of a single variable. Reviewer D. R. Dickinson wrote that it \"contains much novel and interesting material\"; however, he also complained of its pedantic avoidance of variables (using identity functions in their place), its unnecessary insistence on considering only functions whose derivative has the same domain as the function itself, and its \"dull and lengthy discussions of elementary topics\".

Its goal is both to show how the real numbers can be developed from simpler concepts in arithmetic, and to demonstrate the impact of logic on the rest of mathematics.

      " Allofeeding can occur between mates during mating rituals, courtship, egg laying or incubation, between peers of the same species, or as a form of parental care. Allofeeding evolved for different reasons in different species of birds. While sagebrush Brewer's sparrows allofeed to reduce predation during incubation, Sichuan jays allofeed to increase a female's nutritional level prior to egg laying, and chinstrap penguins allofeed to strengthen the bond between the pair during chick guarding. While parental allofeeding is a common form of parental care among many species of birds, the practice is not inherently restricted to biological parents and their young, and is often done for reasons unrelated to the well-being of the chicks Arabian babblers, for instance, peer allofeed in an attempt at increasing their social rank, whereas the king penguin considers those 'non-breeders' who allofeed chicks to be altruistic and highly revered.\n",

      "B: APDS is an automated chemical, biological, and nuclear detection and identification system that can detect and identify bio-agents in real time.\n",

      "original_text:\n",
      "  If that detector returns a positive result, APDS performs a second assay based on nucleic-acid amplification and detection. Having two different assay systems increases system reliability and minimizes the possibility of false positives. The immunoassay detector incorporates liquid arrays, a multiplexed assay that uses small-diameter polystyrene beads (microbeads) coated with thousands of antibodies. Each microbead is colored with a unique combination of red- and orange-emitting dyes. The number of agents that can be detected in a sample is limited only by the number of colored bead sets. When the sample is exposed to the beads, a bioagent, if present, binds to the bead with the appropriate antibody. A second fluorescently labeled antibody is then added to the sample, resulting in a highly fluorescent target for flow analysis. Preparing the sample and performing this first analysis takes less than 30 minutes. Nucleic acid assays require amplification of one or more target sequences of nucleic acid. Short strands of single-stranded DNA are synthesized in known sequences and attached to spots in the array in a predetermined way Detection of these spots that contain hybridized target DNA allows one to the sequence of DNA in the unknown target. RNA readily hybridizes to form double-stranded structures to its complementary sequence (A-T, C-G, G-C, U-A). Thus, arrays of single-stranded DNA can be used to detect RNA via hybridization. TABLE 1.1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Prioritized List of Biological Threat Agentsa Research Internationals sells standalone and portable systems for use in mailrooms, called ASAP II. ASAP II gives real time detection of bio-warfare agents, chemical agents and toxic industrial chemicals, explosives in particulate and vapor form and nuclear materials. The system can be customised according to the need of the mailroom. ASAP II is an automated chemical, biological and nuclear detection and identification system. The system can detect and identify from four (RAPTOR module) to eight (BioHawk module) bio-agents in real time. Periodically or on demand, a concentrated sample is sent to the modules and within fifteen minutes these systems will identify the presence of any bioagents and notify the operator if a hazardous agent is detected. The systems need to be in a negative pressure room on a downward draft table. An air sampling module within the systems draws air into the downward draft table for analysis. Sampling is continuous until the batch of mail is complete, which may take a few minutes, hours or days. The systems are able to handle thousands of pieces of mail per hour. The system can be adapted for situations where environmental or clinical pathogens require monitoring. For example, APDS could test for mold or fungal spores in buildings or for the airborne spread of contagious materials in hospitals. It also could identify disease outbreaks in livestock transport centers or feedlots. In water, APDS can detect pathogens in wastewater, agricultural irrigation lines, food processors, fish farms, and beaches. Research International produces and sells the TacBio particle detection system. The system samples the air continuously and monitors for  aerosol particle or bio-particle levels It does not identify the type of bio-particle detected but will notify the mailroom attendant if either excess particles or bio-particles are present. This is an early warning system that gives the mailroom supervisor enough time to notice a potential threat and to test for biological agents or airborne threats before mail is delivered to a recipient. ChemPRO 100 Chemical Detection System is a handheld chemical detector for field detection and classification of Chemical Warfare Agents. If mail arrives with an unidentified substance, this hand held detector can be used to immediately identify the chemical. Hardened Mobile Trace Explosive Particle tests for a wide range of explosives and narcotics in seconds. The system will identify explosives in packages or envelopes that are often undetectable by x-ray machines. This handheld detector expands the range of target explosives you can identify in a single sample for faster more comprehensive screening. As noted, this system also detects a wide range of narcotics. The system tests for explosives and narcotics simultaneously in a single sample, for faster, more comprehensive screening. Kraken Sense produces the KRAKEN autonomous pathogen detection system. The device continuously samples any water source in real-time, delivering results in as low as 60 minutes to alert of potential contamination. If contamination is detected in agricultural water sources or food processors, for example, operators can remove the compromised batch before the product enters the market, preventing foodborne illness\n",

      "#Autonomous detection system\n",
      " APDS monitors air and water for the three types of biological threat agents: bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The autonomous detection system is capable of (1) rapidly processing and accurately analyzing aerosol or water samples with a high level of confidence; (2) automating and integrating the major system functions into the detector, including sample collection, preparation, analysis, and analytical results reporting; (3) operating in its intended indoor and outdoor environments; and (4) disseminating and archiving analysis results and system operational data via the C3 network, known as the BioWatch Gen-3 Operations Support Service. APDS operates continuously; the system can detect low concentrations of bioagents that might go undetected by a system that is triggered only when the overall number of particles in the air is high. APDS collects samples, prepares them for analysis, and tests for multiple biological agents This automation reduces the cost and staffing that would be required to manually analyze samples.\n",

      "  This form includes several parameters; each member of the family of AMBER force fields provides values for these parameters and has its own name. The functional form of the AMBER force field is V ( r N ) = ∑ i ∈ bonds k b i ( l i − l i 0 ) 2 + ∑ i ∈ angles k a i ( θ i − θ i 0 ) 2 {\\displaystyle V(r^{N})=\\sum _{i\\in {\\text{bonds}}}{k_{b}}_{i}(l_{i}-l_{i}^{0})^{2}+\\sum _{i\\in {\\text{angles}}}{k_{a}}_{i}(\\theta _{i}-\\theta _{i}^{0})^{2}} + ∑ i ∈ torsions ∑ n 1 2 V i n [ 1 + cos ⁡ ( n ω i − γ i ) ] {\\displaystyle +\\sum _{i\\in {\\text{torsions}}}\\sum _{n}{\\frac {1}{2}}V_{i}^{n}[1+\\cos(n\\omega _{i}-\\gamma _{i})]} + ∑ j = 1 N − 1 ∑ i = j + 1 N f i j { ϵ i j [ ( r i j 0 r i j ) 12 − 2 ( r i j 0 r i j ) 6 ] + q i q j 4 π ϵ 0 r i j } {\\displaystyle +\\sum _{j=1}^{N-1}\\sum _{i=j+1}^{N}f_{ij}{\\biggl \\{}\\epsilon _{ij}{\\biggl [}\\left({\\frac {r_{ij}^{0}}{r_{ij}}}\\right)^{12}-2\\left({\\frac {r_{ij}^{0}}{r_{ij}}}\\right)^{6}{\\biggr ]}+{\\frac {q_{i}q_{j}}{4\\pi \\epsilon _{0}r_{ij}}}{\\biggr \\}}} Despite the term force field, this equation defines the potential energy of the system; the force is the derivative of this potential relative to position. The meanings of right hand side terms are: First term (summing over bonds): represents the energy between covalently bonded atoms. This harmonic (ideal spring) force is a good approximation near the equilibrium bond length, but becomes increasingly poor as atoms separate. Second term (summing over angles): represents the energy due to the geometry of electron orbitals involved in covalent bonding. Third term (summing over torsions): represents the energy for twisting a bond due to bond order (e.g., double bonds) and neighboring bonds or lone pairs of electrons. One bond may have more than one of these terms, such that the total torsional energy is expressed as a Fourier series. Fourth term (double summation over i {\\displaystyle i} and j {\\displaystyle j} ): represents the non-bonded energy between all atom pairs, which can be decomposed into van der Waals (first term of summation) and electrostatic (second term of summation) energies. The form of the van der Waals energy is calculated using the equilibrium distance ( r i j 0 {\\displaystyle r_{ij}^{0}} ) and well depth ( ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } ). The factor of 2 {\\displaystyle 2} ensures that the equilibrium distance is r i j 0 {\\displaystyle r_{ij}^{0}} . The energy is sometimes reformulated in terms of σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } , where r i j 0 = 2 1 / 6 ( σ ) {\\displaystyle r_{ij}^{0}=2^{1/6}(\\sigma )} , as used e.g. in the implementation of the softcore potentials. The form of the electrostatic energy used here assumes that the charges due to the protons and electrons in an atom can be represented by a single point charge (or in the case of parameter sets that employ lone pairs, a small number of point charges.) To use the AMBER force field, it is necessary to have values for the parameters of the force field (e.g. force constants, equilibrium bond lengths and angles, charges). A fairly large number of these parameter sets exist, and are described in detail in the AMBER software user manual. Each parameter set has a name, and provides parameters for certain types of molecules. Peptide, protein, and nucleic acid parameters are provided by parameter sets with names starting with \"ff\" and containing a two digit year number, for instance \"ff99\". As of 2018 the primary protein model used by the AMBER suit is the ff14SB force field. General AMBER force field (GAFF) provides parameters for small organic molecules to facilitate simulations of drugs and small molecule ligands in conjunction with biomolecules. The GLYCAM force fields have been developed by Rob Woods for simulating carbohydrates. The primary force field used in the AMBER suit for lipids is lipid14. The AMBER software suite provides a set of programs to apply the AMBER forcefields to simulations of biomolecules. It is written in the programming languages Fortran 90 and C, with support for most major Unix-like operating systems and compilers. Development is conducted by a loose association of mostly academic labs. New versions are released usually in the spring of even numbered years; AMBER 10 was released in April 2008. The software is available under a site license agreement, which includes full source, currently priced at US$500 for non-commercial and US$20,000 for commercial organizations. LEaP prepares input files for the simulation programs. Antechamber automates the process of parameterizing small organic molecules using GAFF. Simulated Annealing with NMR-Derived Energy Restraints (SANDER) is the central simulation program and provides facilities for energy minimizing and molecular dynamics with a wide variety of options. pmemd is a somewhat more feature-limited reimplementation of SANDER by Bob Duke. It was designed for parallel computing, and performs significantly better than SANDER when running on more than 8–16 processors. pmemd.cuda runs simulations on machines with graphics processing units (GPUs). pmemd.amoeba handles the extra parameters in the polarizable AMOEBA force field\n",

      "  The name comes from Arabic اَلْمَجِسْطِيّ al-majisṭī, with اَل al meaning \"the\", and magesti being a corruption of Greek μεγίστη megístē 'greatest'.[citation needed] The work was originally titled \"Μαθηματικὴ Σύνταξις\" (Mathēmatikē Syntaxis) in Koine Greek, and also called Syntaxis Mathematica in Latin. The treatise was later titled Hē Megalē Syntaxis (Ἡ Μεγάλη Σύνταξις, \"The Great Treatise\"; Latin: Magna Syntaxis), and the superlative form of this (Ancient Greek: μεγίστη, megiste, \"greatest\") lies behind the Arabic name al-majisṭī (المجسطي), from which the English name Almagest derives. The Arabic name is important due to the popularity of a Latin translation known as Almagestum made in the 12th century from an Arabic translation, which would endure until original Greek copies resurfaced in the 15th century.[citation needed] The Syntaxis Mathematica consists of thirteen sections, called books. As with many medieval manuscripts that were handcopied or, particularly, printed in the early years of printing, there were considerable differences between various editions of the same text, as the process of transcription was highly personal. An example illustrating how the Syntaxis was organized is given below; it is a Latin edition printed in 1515 at Venice by Petrus Lichtenstein. Book I contains an outline of Aristotle's cosmology: on the spherical form of the heavens, with the spherical Earth lying motionless as the center, with the fixed stars and the various planets revolving around the Earth. Then follows an explanation of chords with table of chords; observations of the obliquity of the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun through the stars); and an introduction to spherical trigonometry. Book II covers problems associated with the daily motion attributed to the heavens, namely risings and settings of celestial objects, the length of daylight, the determination of latitude, the points at which the Sun is vertical, the shadows of the gnomon at the equinoxes and solstices, and other observations that change with the observer's position. There is also a study of the angles made by the ecliptic with the vertical, with tables. Book III covers the length of the year, and the motion of the Sun. Ptolemy explains Hipparchus' discovery of the precession of the equinoxes and begins explaining the theory of epicycles. Books IV and V cover the motion of the Moon, lunar parallax, the motion of the lunar apogee, and the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon relative to the Earth. Book VI covers solar and lunar eclipses. Books VII and VIII cover the motions of the fixed stars, including precession of the equinoxes. They also contain a star catalogue of 1022 stars, described by their positions in the constellations, together with ecliptic longitude and latitude. Book IX addresses general issues associated with creating models for the five naked eye planets, and the motion of Mercury. Book X covers the motions of Venus and Mars. Book XI covers the motions of Jupiter and Saturn. Book XII covers stations and retrograde motion, which occurs when planets appear to pause, then briefly reverse their motion against the background of the zodiac. Ptolemy understood these terms to apply to Mercury and Venus as well as the outer planets. Book XIII covers motion in latitude, that is, the deviation of planets from the ecliptic. The cosmology of the Syntaxis includes five main points, each of which is the subject of a chapter in Book I. What follows is a close paraphrase of Ptolemy's own words from Toomer's translation. The celestial realm is spherical, and moves as a sphere. The Earth is a sphere. The Earth is at the center of the cosmos. The Earth, in relation to the distance of the fixed stars, has no appreciable size and must be treated as a mathematical point. The Earth does not move. The layout of the catalogue has always been tabular. Ptolemy writes explicitly that the coordinates are given as (ecliptical) \"longitudes\" and \"latitudes\", which are given in columns, so this has probably always been the case. It is significant that Ptolemy chooses the ecliptical coordinate system because of his knowledge of precession, which distinguishes him from all his predecessors. Hipparchus' celestial globe had an ecliptic drawn in, but the coordinates were equatorial. Since Hipparchus' star catalogue has not survived in its original form, but was absorbed into the Almagest star catalogue (and heavily revised in the 265 years in between), the Almagest star catalogue is the oldest one in which complete tables of coordinates and magnitudes have come down to us. As mentioned, Ptolemy includes a star catalog containing 1022 stars. He says that he \"observed as many stars as it was possible to perceive, even to the sixth magnitude\", and that the ecliptic longitudes are for the beginning of the reign of Antoninus Pius (138 AD). Ptolemy himself states that he found that the longitudes had increased by 2° 40′ since the time of Hipparchus which was 265 years earlier (Alm. VII, 2). But calculations show that his ecliptic longitudes correspond more closely to around the middle of the first century CE (+48 to +58)\n",

      "  This method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in a study of prosody (the formal analysis of meter) and phonic effects such as alliteration and rhyme, and cognitively in examination of the interplay of syntactic structures, figurative language, and other elements of the poem that work to produce its larger effects. Modern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes. It is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus. It can be applied in the study of classical concepts of mathematics, such as real numbers, complex variables, trigonometric functions, and algorithms, or of non-classical concepts like constructivism, harmonics, infinity, and vectors. Florian Cajori explains in A History of Mathematics (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows: The terms synthesis and analysis are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic. In ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have. The oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in [appended to] Euclid, XIII. 5, which in all probability was framed by Eudoxus: \"Analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth; synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it.\" The analytic method is not conclusive, unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible. To remove all doubt, the Greeks, as a rule, added to the analytic process a synthetic one, consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis. Thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions. James Gow uses a similar argument as Cajori, with the following clarification, in his A Short History of Greek Mathematics (1884): The synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths. An analytic proof begins by an assumption, upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded. The Greeks distinguished theoretic from problematic analysis. A theoretic analysis is of the following kind. To prove that A is B, assume first that A is B. If so, then, since B is C and C is D and D is E, therefore A is E. If this be known a falsity, A is not B. But if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be convertible, then the reverse process, A is E, E is D, D is C, C is B, therefore A is B, constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem. Problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition. The problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically, and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem. Musical analysis – a process attempting to answer the question \"How does this music work?\" Musical Analysis is a study of how the composers use the notes together to compose music. Those studying music will find differences with each composer's musical analysis, which differs depending on the culture and history of music studied. An analysis of music is meant to simplify the music for you. Schenkerian analysis Schenkerian analysis is a collection of music analysis that focuses on the production of the graphic representation. This includes both analytical procedure as well as the notational style. Simply put, it analyzes tonal music which includes all chords and tones within a composition. Philosophical analysis – a general term for the techniques used by philosophers Philosophical analysis refers to the clarification and composition of words put together and the entailed meaning behind them. Philosophical analysis dives deeper into the meaning of words and seeks to clarify that meaning by contrasting the various definitions. It is the study of reality, justification of claims, and the analysis of various concepts. Branches of philosophy include logic, justification, metaphysics, values and ethics. If questions can be answered empirically, meaning it can be answered by using the senses, then it is not considered philosophical. Non-philosophical questions also include events that happened in the past, or questions science or mathematics can answer. Analysis is the name of a prominent journal in philosophy. Psychoanalysis – seeks to elucidate connections among unconscious components of patients' mental processes Transactional analysis Transactional analysis is used by therapists to try to gain a better understanding of the unconscious. It focuses on understanding and intervening human behavior. Policy analysis – The use of statistical data to predict the effects of policy decisions made by governments and agencies Policy analysis includes a systematic process to find the most efficient and effective option to address the current situation. Qualitative analysis – The use of anecdotal evidence to predict the effects of policy decisions or, more generally, influence policy decisions Finite element analysis – a computer simulation technique used in engineering analysis Independent component analysis Link quality analysis – the analysis of signal quality Path quality analysis Fourier analysis In statistics, the term analysis may refer to any method used for data analysis. Among the many such methods, some are: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) – a collection of statistical models and their associated procedures which compare means by splitting the overall observed variance into different parts Boolean analysis – a method to find deterministic dependencies between variables in a sample, mostly used in exploratory data analysis Cluster analysis – techniques for finding groups (called clusters), based on some measure of proximity or similarity Factor analysis – a method to construct models describing a data set of observed variables in terms of a smaller set of unobserved variables (called factors) Meta-analysis – combines the results of several studies that address a set of related research hypotheses Multivariate analysis – analysis of data involving several variables, such as by factor analysis, regression analysis, or principal component analysis Principal component analysis – transformation of a sample of correlated variables into uncorrelated variables (called principal components), mostly used in exploratory data analysis Regression analysis – techniques for analysing the relationships between several predictive variables and one or more outcomes in the data Scale analysis (statistics) – methods to analyse survey data by scoring responses on a numeric scale Sensitivity analysis – the study of how the variation in the output of a model depends on variations in the inputs Sequential analysis – evaluation of sampled data as it is collected, until the criterion of a stopping rule is met Spatial analysis – the study of entities using geometric or geographic properties Time-series analysis – methods that attempt to understand a sequence of data points spaced apart at uniform time intervals Aura analysis – a technique in which supporters of the method claim that the body's aura, or energy field is analysed Bowling analysis – Analysis of the performance of cricket players Lithic analysis – the analysis of stone tools using basic scientific techniques Lithic analysis is most often used by archeologists in determining which types of tools were used at a given time period pertaining to current artifacts discovered.

      " Modern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes. It is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus. It can be applied in the study of classical concepts of mathematics, such as real numbers, complex variables, trigonometric functions, and algorithms, or of non-classical concepts like constructivism, harmonics, infinity, and vectors. Florian Cajori explains in A History of Mathematics (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows: The terms synthesis and analysis are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic In ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have. The oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in [appended to] Euclid, XIII.\n",

      "Ateliosis or ateleiosis is a diagnosis used in the early 1900s to describe patients with short stature. Ateliosis literally means \"failure to achieve perfection\", and was used to describe proportional dwarfism. The term was popularised by Hastings Gilford, who used the term to refer to forms of dwarfism associated with and without sexual maturation. Ateliosis was reported as early as 1904 in relation to progeria, a syndrome of premature aging. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, it is \"dwarfism associated with anterior pituitary deficiencies and marked by essentially normal intelligence and proportions though often retarded sexual development\". The physical characteristics include: normal facial features, childlike high pitched voice, proportioned body, and abnormal genitalia. Their mental development is normal to slightly delayed. Hastings Gilford originated the term to describe patients with \"continuous youth\".\n",

      "original_text:\n",
      " An alloprotein is a novel synthetic protein containing one or more \"non-natural\" amino acids. Non-natural in the context means an amino acid either not occurring in nature (novel and synthesised amino acids), or occurring in nature but not naturally occurring within proteins (natural but non-proteinogenic amino acids). The possibility for novel amino acids and proteins arises because, in nature, the genetic code responsible for protein structure has 64 possible codons available for encoding all amino acids used in proteins (4 nucleotides in each of 3 bases; 4 x 4 x 4 gives 64 possible combinations); however, in human beings and other eukaryotes, these encode for just 20 standard amino acids. This level of information redundancy within the codon table is known in biochemistry as degeneracy. It opens the door for new amino acids to be potentially encoded. One approach takes advantage of the redundancy of the 3 codons that encode a \"stop\" signal. If one of these can be substituted by another stop codon, then that codon can in principle be \"reassigned\" (along with requisite tRNA, release factor and enzyme modifications) to code for a novel amino acid without affecting other existing codings. Using this approach, alloproteins and novel amino acids can be created by techniques that \"expand\" the genetic code to include additional novel codings, using newly devised codons and related tRNA (transfer RNA) and tRNA synthetase enzymes (aminoacyl tRNA synthetase). The usual mechanisms, which produce amino acids and combine them into proteins, then produce novel or non-proteinogenic amino acids and incorporate them to make novel proteins the same way. In 2010 this technique was used to reassign a codon in the genetic code of the bacterium E. coli, modifying it to produce and incorporate a novel amino acid, without adversely affecting existing encodings or the organism itself. Alloprotein uses include the incorporation of unusual or heavy atoms for diffractive structure analysis, photo-reactive linkers (photocrosslinkers), fluorescent groups (used as labelled probes), and molecular switches for signaling pathways. Modern alloprotein techniques were first developed in the late 1980s by Miyazawa and Yokoyama at the University of Tokyo to address limitations of existing methods: genetic manipulation was limited to the 20 standard amino acids, chemical synthesis was limited to small scale and low yield. An early use of the term is found in a 1990 paper \"Biosynthesis of alloprotein\", by Koide, Yokoyama and Miyazawa. A working description is provided by Budisa et al: \"Genetic code engineering is [a] new research field that intent to reprogram protein synthesis by reassignment of specific codons to non-canonical (mainly synthetic) amino acids. The resulting proteins are alloproteins with tailor-made properties that are of outstanding interest for both, academia and industrial biotechnology.\" Expanded Genetic Code System Research Team, Yokohama Institute, Japan Method for producing protein containing nonprotein amino acids - 1988, Miyazawa & Yokoyama et al. Description states: The present invention relates to a method for producing proteins comprising nonprotein amino acids (hereinafter referred to as non-natural proteins) using protein-producing organisms.

      "#Alloprotein\n",
      "An alloprotein is a novel synthetic protein containing one or more \"non-natural\" amino acids. Non-natural in the context means an amino acid either not occurring in nature (novel and synthesised amino acids), or occurring in nature but not naturally occurring within proteins (natural but non-proteinogenic amino acids). The possibility for novel amino acids and proteins arises because, in nature, the genetic code responsible for protein structure has 64 possible codons available for encoding all amino acids used in proteins (4 nucleotides in each of 3 bases; 4 x 4 x 4 gives 64 possible combinations); however, in human beings and other eukaryotes, these encode for just 20 standard amino acids. This level of information redundancy within the codon table is known in biochemistry as degeneracy It opens the door for new amino acids to be potentially encoded.\n",

      "  Alan Hastings published his first paper, dealing with eliminating viability differences in computing recombination percentages, in 1972 at the age of 19. This was the beginning of an extensive career in theoretical and mathematical ecology, with Alan credited for another 333 publications since. He received his Bachelors of Science in mathematics from Cornell University the following year, and he would follow this up with a Masters in Applied Mathematics from Cornell in 1975. Alan finished his formal education with a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics with minors in Population Ecology and Population Genetics from Cornell in 1977, with his dissertation being done on population biology modeling. He began a career in education in 1977 at Washington State University, where he worked as an assistant professor in the Department of Pure and Applied Mathematics for two years. In 1979, he began working as an assistant professor for the University of California, Davis, where he has been teaching ever since. Alan started off in the Department of Mathematics, and continued there between 1979 and 1989, becoming an associate Professor in 1982, and a fully fledged Professor in 1985. In 1983, he also began working in the Department of Environmental Science, where he worked until 2019 when he became a distinguished Professor Emeritus. As of 2022[update] Hastings is an External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute, a position held since 2018. Alan is noted for his \"exceptional and original contributions to ecology and evolutionary biology\", \"earning honors including election to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\". With 36,590 citations as of 2021, Alan is possibly the most respected and referenced theoretical ecologists in the world.

      " Knowledge which is defined in terms of partitions has the property of negative introspection. That is, agents know that they do not know what they do not know. However, it is possible to show that it is impossible to agree to disagree even when knowledge does not have this property. Halpern and Kets argued that players can agree to disagree in the presence of ambiguity, even if there is a common prior However, allowing for ambiguity is more restrictive than assuming heterogeneous priors. The impossibility of agreeing to disagree, in Aumann's theorem, is a necessary condition for the existence of a common prior. A stronger condition can be formulated in terms of bets. A bet is a set of random variables f a {\\displaystyle f_{a}} , one for each agent a {\\displaystyle a} , such the ∑ a f a = 0 {\\displaystyle \\sum _{a}f_{a}=0} .\n",

      "  The elements have been shown to function in other plants, including tobacco, Arabidopsis,) and rice. Genomic analysis of maize show that these elements, which share terminal 11 bp imperfect inverted repeat sequences, have much sequence heterogeneity, both in length and content. They also include a class of DNA elements that do not transpose in the presence of the Ac element (Du et al. 2011). The chromosome breaking property has been shown to come from pairs of closely positioned elements. Researchers use mutant phenotypes to discover gene functions. Ac/Ds prefer to transpose to nearby genes, affording a way to mutagenize those regions of the genome, and by subsequent genetic crosses, remove the Ac that causes new mutants and instability of a Ds mutant. Collections of Ac/Ds elements that cover the genome and are useful for generating mutants. Application of Ac/Ds toolkits has also been applied to other species like arabidopsis, yeast, and even zebrafish. Activator (Ac)/ Dissociation (Ds) transposable elements were discovered by Barbara McClintock when she was studying the maize genomic composition of the short arm of chromosome 9. She noticed that when chromosome 9 had been exposed to drastic structural modifications, the progeny had changes such as multiple copies of the short arm or lacking one or more of its parts, as well as other changes. She believed that these changes were due to transposition of “mutable loci” into the genome and that these spontaneous translocations were not random due to where the breaks occurred and where they fused. Ac/Ds elements have been observed to insert into gene rich regions of the maize genome, they alter the regulation of gene expression and may create unstable insertion alleles, stable derivatives, or excision alleles due to insertion of a transposable element into a gene. Transposable elements residing at or near a gene prevent gene expression and can also result in a mutation that causes exhibition of the recessive phenotype. Removal of transposable element locus results in restoration of the gene organization and activity. Ac is 4565 base pairs long and codes for a 3.5 kb open reading frame that synthesizes an 807 amino acid long transposase enzyme. Ac elements are autonomous and their movement results in a 4.3 kb insertion. Ds elements are not autonomous because they cannot produce the transposase needed for transposition, and can only transpose when it is provided by the Ac element. Ds elements have shown to cause a 4.1kB and 2.0 kB insertions. The transposable elements were seen in progeny of plants that had undergone stress, and mutations caused by the insertion are like those caused by x-rays, UV light, or chemicals causing events like chromosome breakage and fusion. There are distinct families of transposon controlling elements that are made up of a combination of elements some that can, and some that cannot, transpose. The families differ in their developmental timing and transposition frequency, as well other types of genetic rearrangements. Ac or Ds element insertion near a locus causes unstable mutations. Ds elements are considered non-autonomous because they cannot transpose without the presence of the Ac element, since they themselves cannot produce the enzyme transposase needed for transposition. However, since Ds elements can utilize the transposase enzyme produced by the Ac elements, it shows that they have the structural information needed for transposition and only lack the information needed to produce the enzyme. Ds elements were identified at the site of a chromosome breakage. Ac and Ds elements are structurally related because insertion of either element brings about similar mutations. They are also similar because their restriction endonuclease cleavage site maps are indistinguishable from each other. Different mutants display different levels of gene expression, which largely depends on the presence or absence of the transposable element somewhere else in the genome. The different function of the elements are detected as altered temporal or spatial patterns of somatic reversions or reversible inactivation of the entire element. Some excision events of these elements restore gene function and can be detected as somatic reversions. If Ac or Ds insertions in an exon, and the transposable elements are excised leaving some of the duplicated base pairs behind, it alters the protein structure either by causing mutations such as frame shift mutations or the addition of amino acids. In some cases, unstable Ds or Ac induced mutant can give rise to a stable recessive mutant. Ac determines the mutation process and the mutable loci as well as their timing. Ac transposase does not influence transcription initiation site selection, and large numbers of Ac elements may inhibit the expression of Ds by reducing the rate of transcription initiation instead of affecting the transcription site selection. Ac transposase is also capable of suppressing gene expression when Ac or Ds inserts in 5’ untranslated region using target sites\n",

In 1955, he became associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania, achieving full professorship in 1958 and retiring in 1994. Klein studied models of collective behavior in finite many-body systems, especially in nuclear physics, for example in Boson model and in an extension of the Hartree–Fock method with Robert Kerman (Kerman–Klein method). In the 1980s he occupied himself with, among other things, the interacting boson model, and in the 1970s with quantum field theory in strong fields (with Johann Rafelski). In 1964, Klein published an article about spontaneous symmetry breaking with his student Benjamin W.\n",

      "  Adrenaline has a β2 adrenoceptor-mediated effect on metabolism and the airway, with no direct neural connection from the sympathetic ganglia to the airway. Walter Bradford Cannon originally proposed the concept of the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic nervous system being involved in the flight, fight, and fright response. But the adrenal medulla, in contrast to the adrenal cortex, is not required for survival. In adrenalectomized patients, hemodynamic and metabolic responses to stimuli such as hypoglycemia and exercise remain normal. One physiological stimulus to adrenaline secretion is exercise. This was first demonstrated by measuring the dilation of a (denervated) pupil of a cat on a treadmill, later confirmed using a biological assay of urine samples. Biochemical methods for measuring catecholamines in plasma were published from 1950 onwards. Although much valuable work has been published using fluorimetric assays to measure total catecholamine concentrations, the method is too non-specific and insensitive to accurately determine the very small quantities of adrenaline in plasma. The development of extraction methods and enzyme–isotope derivate radio-enzymatic assays (REA) transformed the analysis down to a sensitivity of 1 pg for adrenaline. Early REA plasma assays indicated that adrenaline and total catecholamines rise late in exercise, mostly when anaerobic metabolism commences. During exercise, the adrenaline blood concentration rises partially from the increased secretion of the adrenal medulla and partly from the decreased metabolism of adrenaline due to reduced blood flow to the liver. Infusion of adrenaline to reproduce exercise circulating concentrations of adrenaline in subjects at rest has little hemodynamic effect other than a slight β2-mediated fall in diastolic blood pressure. Infusion of adrenaline well within the physiological range suppresses human airway hyper-reactivity sufficiently to antagonize the constrictor effects of inhaled histamine. A link between the sympathetic nervous system and the lungs was shown in 1887 when Grossman showed that stimulation of cardiac accelerator nerves reversed muscarine-induced airway constriction. In experiments in the dog, where the sympathetic chain was cut at the level of the diaphragm, Jackson showed that there was no direct sympathetic innervation to the lung, but bronchoconstriction was reversed by the release of adrenaline from the adrenal medulla. An increased incidence of asthma has not been reported for adrenalectomized patients; those with a predisposition to asthma will have some protection from airway hyper-reactivity from their corticosteroid replacement therapy. Exercise induces progressive airway dilation in normal subjects that correlates with workload and is not prevented by beta-blockade. The progressive airway dilation with increasing exercise is mediated by a progressive reduction in resting vagal tone. Beta blockade with propranolol causes a rebound in airway resistance after exercise in normal subjects over the same time course as the bronchoconstriction seen with exercise-induced asthma. The reduction in airway resistance during exercise reduces the work of breathing. Every emotional response has a behavioral, an autonomic, and a hormonal component. The hormonal component includes the release of adrenaline, an adrenomedullary response to stress controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The major emotion studied in relation to adrenaline is fear. In an experiment, subjects who were injected with adrenaline expressed more negative and fewer positive facial expressions to fear films compared to a control group. These subjects also reported a more intense fear from the films and greater mean intensity of negative memories than control subjects. The findings from this study demonstrate that there are learned associations between negative feelings and levels of adrenaline. Overall, the greater amount of adrenaline is positively correlated with an aroused state of negative emotions. These findings can be an effect in part that adrenaline elicits physiological sympathetic responses, including an increased heart rate and knee shaking, which can be attributed to the feeling of fear regardless of the actual level of fear elicited from the video. Although studies have found a definite relation between adrenaline and fear, other emotions have not had such results. In the same study, subjects did not express a greater amusement to an amusement film nor greater anger to an anger film. Similar findings were also supported in a study that involved rodent subjects that either were able or unable to produce adrenaline. Findings support the idea that adrenaline has a role in facilitating the encoding of emotionally arousing events, contributing to higher levels of arousal due to fear. It has been found that adrenergic hormones, such as adrenaline, can produce retrograde enhancement of long-term memory in humans. The release of adrenaline due to emotionally stressful events, which is endogenous adrenaline, can modulate memory consolidation of the events, ensuring memory strength that is proportional to memory importance. Post-learning adrenaline activity also interacts with the degree of arousal associated with the initial coding. There is evidence that suggests adrenaline does have a role in long-term stress adaptation and emotional memory encoding specifically. Adrenaline may also play a role in elevating arousal and fear memory under particular pathological conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Overall, \"Extensive evidence indicates that epinephrine (EPI) modulates memory consolidation for emotionally arousing tasks in animals and human subjects.\" Studies have also found that recognition memory involving adrenaline depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors. Adrenaline does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery\n",

Although the spacewalk was originally planned for 5 hours and 30 minutes, it was cut short due to a cooling system malfunction in Kaleri's spacesuit. Kaleri reported seeing drops of water on the inside of his spacesuit's visor. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 55 minutes. The excursion was the fifth career spacewalk for Kaleri.

      " 12) and Kunen (1980 sec. IV.3)). x is the empty set. x is an ordinal. x is a finite ordinal. x is a successor ordinal. x is a limit ordinal. x = ω. x is (the graph of) a function. Other properties are not absolute: being finite being countable being a cardinal being a regular cardinal being a limit cardinal being an inaccessible cardinal Skolem's paradox is the seeming contradiction that on the one hand, the set of real numbers is uncountable (and this is provable from ZFC, or even from a small finite subsystem ZFC' of ZFC), while on the other hand there are countable transitive models of ZFC' (this is provable in ZFC), and the set of real numbers in such a model will be a countable set. The paradox can be resolved by noting that countability is not absolute to submodels of a particular model of ZFC. It is possible that a set X is countable in a model of set theory but uncountable in a submodel containing X, because the submodel may contain no bijection between X and ω, while the definition of countability is the existence of such a bijection. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, when applied to ZFC, shows that this situation does occur. Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem shows that Π 2 1 {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{2}^{1}} and Σ 2 1 {\\displaystyle \\Sigma _{2}^{1}} sentences in the analytical hierarchy are absolute between a model V of ZF and the constructible universe L of the model, when interpreted as statements about the natural numbers in each model. The theorem can be relativized to allow the sentence to use sets of natural numbers from V as parameters, in which case L must be replaced by the smallest submodel containing those parameters and all the ordinals. The theorem has corollaries that Σ 3 1 {\\displaystyle \\Sigma _{3}^{1}} sentences are upward absolute (if such a sentence holds in L then it holds in V) and Π 3 1 {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{3}^{1}} sentences are downward absolute (if they hold in V then they hold in L). Because any two transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals have the same constructible universe, Shoenfield's theorem shows that two such models must agree about the truth of all Π 2 1 {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{2}^{1}} sentences. One consequence of Shoenfield's theorem relates to the axiom of choice. Gödel proved that the constructible universe L always satisfies ZFC, including the axiom of choice, even when V is only assumed to satisfy ZF. Shoenfield's theorem shows that if there is a model of ZF in which a given Σ 3 1 {\\displaystyle \\Sigma _{3}^{1}} statement φ is false, then φ is also false in the constructible universe of that model. In contrapositive, this means that if ZFC proves a Σ 3 1 {\\displaystyle \\Sigma _{3}^{1}} sentence then that sentence is also provable in ZF. The same argument can be applied to any other principle that always holds in the constructible universe, such as the combinatorial principle ◊. Even if these principles are independent of ZF, each of their Σ 3 1 {\\displaystyle \\Sigma _{3}^{1}} consequences is already provable in ZF. In particular, this includes any of their consequences that can be expressed in the (first-order) language of Peano arithmetic. Shoenfield's theorem also shows that there are limits to the independence results that can be obtained by forcing. In particular, any sentence of Peano arithmetic is absolute to transitive models of set theory with the same ordinals. Thus it is not possible to use forcing to change the truth value of arithmetical sentences, as forcing does not change the ordinals of the model to which it is applied. Many famous open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis and the P = NP problem, can be expressed as Π 2 1 {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{2}^{1}} sentences (or sentences of lower complexity), and thus cannot be proven independent of ZFC by forcing. There are certain large cardinals that cannot exist in the constructible universe (L) of any model of set theory. Nevertheless, the constructible universe contains all the ordinal numbers that the original model of set theory contains. This \"paradox\" can be resolved by noting that the defining properties of some large cardinals are not absolute to submodels. One example of such a nonabsolute large cardinal axiom is for measurable cardinals; for an ordinal to be a measurable cardinal there must exist another set (the measure) satisfying certain properties. It can be shown that no such measure is constructible. Conservative extension Lévy hierarchy Jech, Thomas, 2003. Set Theory: The Third Millennium Edition, Revised and Expanded. Springer.

      "Astronomical spectroscopy is the study of astronomy using the techniques of spectroscopy to measure the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray, infrared and radio waves that radiate from stars and other celestial objects  A stellar spectrum can reveal many properties of stars, such as their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance and luminosity  Spectroscopy can show the velocity of motion towards or away from the observer by measuring the Doppler shift  Spectroscopy is also used to study the physical properties of many other types of celestial objects such as planets, nebulae, galaxies, and active galactic nuclei  Astronomical spectroscopy is used to measure three major bands of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum: visible light, radio waves, and X-rays  While all spectroscopy looks at specific bands of the spectrum, different methods are required to acquire the signal depending on the frequency  Ozone (O3) and molecular oxygen (O2) absorb light with wavelengths under 300 nm, meaning that X-ray and ultraviolet spectroscopy require the use of a satellite telescope or rocket mounted detectors : 27  Radio signals have much longer wavelengths than optical signals, and require the use of antennas or radio dishes\n",

Other important areas of research include the development of novel optical techniques for nano-optical measurements, diffractive optics, low-coherence interferometry, optical coherence tomography, and near-field microscopy. Research in optical physics places an emphasis on ultrafast optical science and technology. The applications of optical physics create advancements in communications, medicine, manufacturing, and even entertainment One of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed of atoms, in modern terms the basic unit of a chemical element.

      "The Australia Forum is a proposed convention centre complex for Canberra, Australia  The project was first put forward in 2011, and in 2017 its future became uncertain when the ACT Government withdrew funding for the preparation of a business case for it  In response to what its planners saw as the Australian capital's \"lack of a sufficiently large, high quality, secure venue that can be locked down without disrupting the city, as well as a lack of sufficient accommodation of a suitably high standard\" a proposal was announced on 11 April 2011 for a $328 million complex in what is now Acton park on the shore of the Western basin of Lake Burley Griffin  The complex would include a plenary hall catering for up to 3000, a purpose designed Centre for Dialogue, a ballroom, large exhibition space, restaurants, bars, five-star hotel and associated parking  The centre is expected to be able to securely host political dialogue meetings such as the G20 or CHOGM as well as trade conferences  Whilst the announcement of the plan was received with broad, though not unanimous, approval it was noted in the Canberra Times's supportive editorial that the community rarely embraces such ideas usually for reason of public expenditure or vague public benefit  It was also noted that the Government might also be liable for substantial environmental rehabilitation costs before construction could begin  In March 2010 the Steering Committee for the \"Australia Forum Scoping Study\" was announced subsequent to several previously rejected proposals\n",

      "  So far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole. Despite many physicists turning towards string-based methods to address problems in condensed matter physics[citation needed], some theorists working in this area have expressed doubts about whether the AdS/CFT correspondence can provide the tools needed to realistically model real-world systems. In a letter to Physics Today, Nobel laureate Philip W. Anderson wrote \"As a very general problem with the AdS/CFT approach in condensed-matter theory, we can point to those telltale initials \"CFT\"—conformal field theory. Condensed-matter problems are, in general, neither relativistic nor conformal. Near a quantum critical point, both time and space may be scaling, but even there we still have a preferred coordinate system and, usually, a lattice. There is some evidence of other linear-T phases to the left of the strange metal about which they are welcome to speculate, but again in this case the condensed-matter problem is overdetermined by experimental facts\".

Large conferences also may have a career and job search and interview activities. At some conferences, social or entertainment activities such as tours and receptions can be part of the program Business meetings for learned societies or interest groups can also be part of the conference activities. Academic conferences typically fall into three categories: the themed conference, small conferences organized around a particular topic; the general conference, a conference with a wider focus, with sessions on a wide variety of topics.

      "Adam Guy Riess (born December 16, 1969) is an American astrophysicist and Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute. He is known for his research in using supernovae as cosmological probes. Riess shared both the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Brian P. Schmidt for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Riess was born in Washington, D.C., one of three children. He grew up in Warren, New Jersey, where his father (Naval engineer Michael Riess) owned a frozen-foods distribution company, Bistro International, and his mother (Doris Riess) worked as a clinical psychologist. Michael Riess (1931–2007) immigrated to the United States with his parents (journalist, war correspondent and author Curt Martin Riess and Ilse Posnansky) from Germany on the ship SS Europa (1928) in 1936.\n",

      " Avalonian terranes that constitute Avalonia are the following modern-day regions: northern France, Belgium (the Ardennes), England, Wales, southeastern Ireland, eastern Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick and some coastal parts of New England. The basement consisted of Late Precambrian age arc rocks, and is believed to come from the margin of Gondwana, sometime in the Early Ordovician. Avalonia rifted from Gondwana, during the onset of igneous activity in the Ardennes, Wales, and SE Ireland that consumed the Tornquist Sea oceanic crust. It drifted in a northerly direction and probably collided with Baltica in the Late Ordovician, and then with Laurentia in the Late Devonian Evidence for this is consistent with paleomagnetic data which place Avalonia at a temperate latitude during the Ordovician and in a subtropical latitude during the Late Ordovician through the Devonian.\n",

Based on these assumptions, Dounce speculated that, during protein synthesis, each amino acid would pair with an individual nucleotide; the two other nucleotides surrounding it would determine the specificity of the binding. While the actual mechanism turned out to be different, Dounce's hypothesis that nucleotide triplets code for amino acids was correct, and his speculations \"helped lead to the deciphering of the code.\" In the words of Nirenberg, \"In the review he was far ahead of everybody else [..].

From the 1860s onwards, there have been many thousands of visitors to the mines. However, many other visitors, especially between 1940 and 1960, were ill-equipped and unprepared. This led to a series of accidents that gained the mines a notoriety which still haunts them today The West and Wood Mines were finally blocked in the early 1960s (Jones, 1961). In 1969, the Derbyshire Caving Club obtained permission from the National Trust (the owners) to re-open Wood Mine and since then much has been found by excavation and exploration and thousands of people have visited the mines in supervised groups.\n",

      "  For example, chlorophyll is much more efficient at using the red and blue regions than the green region of the light spectrum to carry out photosynthesis. Therefore, the action spectrum graph would show spikes above the wavelengths representing the colours red and blue. The first action spectrum was made by T. W. Engelmann, who split light into its components by the prism and then illuminated Cladophora placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. He found that bacteria accumulated in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. He thus discovered the effect of the different wavelengths of light on photosynthesis and plotted the first action spectrum of photosynthesis.

      " The different chlorophyll and non-chlorophyll pigments associated with the photosystems all have different absorption spectra, either because the spectra of the different chlorophyll pigments are modified by their local protein environment or because the accessory pigments have intrinsic structural differences. The result is that, in vivo, a composite absorption spectrum of all these pigments is broadened and flattened such that a wider range of visible and infrared radiation is absorbed by plants and algae. Most photosynthetic organisms do not absorb green light well, thus most remaining light under leaf canopies in forests or under water with abundant plankton is green, a spectral effect called the \"green window\". Organisms such as some cyanobacteria and red algae contain accessory phycobiliproteins that absorb green light reaching these habitats In aquatic ecosystems, it is likely that the absorption spectrum of water, along with gilvin and tripton (dissolved and particulate organic matter, respectively), determines phototrophic niche differentiation.\n",

      " It is directly involved in the interaction of the kinetochore, the part of the chromosome at which the mitotic spindle attaches and pulls, and the mitotic spindle's extended microtubules. It is speculated that Aurora B cooperates with Aurora A to complete this task. In the absence of Aurora A mad2, a protein that normally dissipates once a proper kinetochore-microtubule connection is made, remains present even into metaphase. Finally, Aurora A helps orchestrate an exit from mitosis by contributing to the completion of cytokinesis- the process by which the cytoplasm of the parent cell is split into two daughter cells During cytokinesis the mother centriole returns to the mid-body of the mitotic cell at the end of mitosis and causes the central microtubules to release from the mid-body.\n",
