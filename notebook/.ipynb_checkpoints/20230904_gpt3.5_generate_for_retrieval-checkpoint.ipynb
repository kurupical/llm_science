      "What is the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) usually higher than? \n",

      " title: Maximum sustainable yield\n",
      "In population ecology and economics, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period. Fundamental to the notion of sustainable harvest, the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely. Under the assumption of logistic growth, resource limitation does not constrain individuals' reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small. At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the carrying capacity, individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate. At this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals. Above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity. At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield. MSY is extensively used for fisheries management. Unlike the logistic (Schaefer) model, MSY has been refined in most modern fisheries models and occurs at around 30% of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method. \n",
      "History\n",
      " The concept of MSY as a fisheries management strategy developed in Belmar, New Jersey, in the early 1930s. It increased in popularity in the 1950s with the advent of surplus- production models with explicitly estimate MSY. As an apparently simple and logical management goal, combined with the lack of other simple management goals of the time, MSY was adopted as the primary management goal by several international organizations (e.g., IWC, IATTC,IATTC, Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission ICCAT, ICNAF), and individual countries. Between 1949 and 1955, the U.S. maneuvered to have MSY declared the goal of international fisheries management (Johnson 2007). The international MSY treaty that was eventually adopted in 1955 gave foreign fleets the right to fish off any coast. Nations that wanted to exclude foreign boats had to first prove that its fish were overfished. As experience was gained with the model, it became apparent to some researchers that it lacked the capability to deal with the real world operational complexities and the influence of trophic and other interactions. In 1977, Peter Larkin wrote its epitaph, challenging the goal of maximum sustained yield on several grounds: It put populations at too much risk; it did not account for spatial variability in productivity; it did not account for species other than the focus of the fishery; it considered only the benefits, not the costs, of fishing; and it was sensitive to political pressure. In fact, none of these criticisms was aimed at sustainability as a goal. The first one noted that seeking the absolute MSY with uncertain parameters was risky. The rest point out that the goal of MSY was not holistic; it left out too many relevant features. Some managers began to use more conservative quota recommendations, but the influence of the MSY model for fisheries management still prevailed. Even while the scientific community was beginning to question the appropriateness and effectiveness of MSY as a management goal, it was incorporated into the 1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea, thus ensuring its integration into national and international fisheries acts and laws. According to Walters and Maguire, an ‘‘institutional juggernaut had been set in motion’’, climaxing in the early 1990s with the collapse of northern cod. \n",

      " Population growth \n",
      " The key assumption behind all sustainable harvesting models such as MSY is that populations of organisms grow and replace themselves – that is, they are renewable resources. Additionally it is assumed that because the growth rates, survival rates, and reproductive rates increase when harvesting reduces population density, they produce a surplus of biomass that can be harvested. Otherwise, sustainable harvest would not be possible. Another assumption of renewable resource harvesting is that populations of organisms do not continue to grow indefinitely; they reach an equilibrium population size, which occurs when the number of individuals matches the resources available to the population (i.e., assume classic logistic growth). At this equilibrium population size, called the carrying capacity, the population remains at a stable size.Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998, pp. 14-17. thumb|300px|right|Figure 1 The logistic model (or logistic function) is a function that is used to describe bounded population growth under the previous two assumptions. The logistic function is bounded at both extremes: when there are not individuals to reproduce, and when there is an equilibrium number of individuals (i.e., at carrying capacity). Under the logistic model, population growth rate between these two limits is most often assumed to be sigmoidal (Figure 1). There is scientific evidence that some populations do grow in a logistic fashion towards a stable equilibrium – a commonly cited example is the logistic growth of yeast. The equation describing logistic growth is: :: N_{t} = \\frac{K}{1 + \\frac{K-N_0}{N_0} e^{-rt}} (equation 1.1) The parameter values are: :: N_{t}=The population size at time t :: K=The carrying capacity of the population :: N_{0}= The population size at time zero :: r= the intrinsic rate of population increase (the rate at which the population grows when it is very small) From the logistic function, the population size at any point can be calculated as long as r, K, and N_{0} are known. thumb|300px|right|Figure 2 Differentiating equation 1.1 give an expression for how the rate of population increases as N increases. At first, the population growth rate is fast, but it begins to slow as the population grows until it levels off to the maximum growth rate, after which it begins to decrease (figure 2). The equation for figure 2 is the differential of equation 1.1 (Verhulst's 1838 growth model): :: \\frac{dN}{dt} = r N \\left(1 - \\frac {N}{K} \\right) (equation 1.2) \\frac{dN}{dt} can be understood as the change in population (N) with respect to a change in time (t). Equation 1.2 is the usual way in which logistic growth is represented mathematically and has several important features. First, at very low population sizes, the value of \\frac{N}{K} is small, so the population growth rate is approximately equal to rN, meaning the population is growing exponentially at a rate r (the intrinsic rate of population increase). Despite this, the population growth rate is very low (low values on the y-axis of figure 2) because, even though each individual is reproducing at a high rate, there are few reproducing individuals present. Conversely, when the population is large the value of \\frac{N}{K} approaches 1 effectively reducing the terms inside the brackets of equation 1.2 to zero. The effect is that the population growth rate is again very low, because either each individual is hardly reproducing or mortality rates are high. As a result of these two extremes, the population growth rate is maximum at an intermediate population or half the carrying capacity (N= \\frac{K}{2}). \n",
      " MSY model \n",
      " thumb|300px|right|Figure 3 The simplest way to model harvesting is to modify the logistic equation so that a certain number of individuals is continuously removed: :: \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right) - H (equation 1.3) Where H represents the number of individuals being removed from the population – that is, the harvesting rate. When H is constant, the population will be at equilibrium when the number of individuals being removed is equal to the population growth rate (figure 3). The equilibrium population size under a particular harvesting regime can be found when the population is not growing – that is, when \\frac{dN}{dt} = 0. This occurs when the population growth rate is the same as the harvest rate: :: rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right) = H Figure 3 shows how growth rate varies with population density. For low densities (far from carrying capacity), there is little addition (or \"recruitment\") to the population, simply because there are few organisms to give birth. At high densities, though, there is intense competition for resources, and growth rate is again low because the death rate is high. In between these two extremes, the population growth rate rises to a maximum value ( N_{MSY}). This maximum point represents the maximum number of individuals that can be added to a population by natural processes. If more individuals than this are removed from the population, the population is at risk for decline to extinction.Jennings, S., Kaiser, M.J. and Reynolds, J.D. (2001), Marine Fisheries Ecology Blackwell Science Ltd. Malden, MA. The maximum number that can be harvested in a sustainable manner, called the maximum sustainable yield, is given by this maximum point. Figure 3 also shows several possible values for the harvesting rate, H. At H_1, there are two possible population equilibrium points: a low population size (N_a) and a high one (N_b). At H_2, a slightly higher harvest rate, however there is only one equilibrium point (at N_{MSY}), which is the population size that produces the maximum growth rate. With logistic growth, this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, is where the population size is half the carrying capacity (or N = \\frac{K}{2}). The maximum sustainable yield is the largest yield that can be taken from a population at equilibrium. In figure 3, if H is higher than H_2, the harvesting would exceed the population's capacity to replace itself at any population size ( H_3 in figure 3). Because harvesting rate is higher than the population growth rate at all values of N, this rate of harvesting is not sustainable. An important feature of the MSY model is how harvested populations respond to environmental fluctuations or illegal offtake. Consider a population at N_b harvested at a constant harvest level H_1. If the population falls (due to a bad winter or illegal harvest) this will ease density-dependent population regulation and increase yield, moving the population back to N_b, a stable equilibrium. In this case, a negative feedback loop creates stability. The lower equilibrium point for the constant harvest level H_1 is not stable however; a population crash or illegal harvesting will decrease population yield farther below the current harvest level, creating a positive feedback loop leading to extinction. Harvesting at N_{MSY} is also potentially unstable. A small decrease in the population can lead to a positive feedback loop and extinction if the harvesting regime (H_2) is not reduced. Thus, some consider harvesting at MSY to be unsafe on ecological and economic grounds.Milner-Gulland, E.J., Mace, R. (1998), Conservation of biological resources Wiley-Blackwell. . The MSY model itself can be modified to harvest a certain percentage of the population or with constant effort constraints rather than an actual number, thereby avoiding some of its instabilities. The MSY equilibrium point is semi-stable – a small increase in population size is compensated for, a small decrease to extinction if H is not decreased. Harvesting at MSY is therefore dangerous because it is on a knife-edge – any small population decline leads to a positive feedback, with the population declining rapidly to extinction if the number of harvested stays the same. The formula for maximum sustained harvest (H) is one-fourth the maximum population or carrying capacity (K) times the intrinsic rate of growth (r).Bolden, E.G., Robinson, W.L. (1999), Wildlife ecology and management 4th ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ. H = \\frac{Kr}{4} \n",
      " For demographically structured populations \n",
      " The principle of MSY often holds for age-structured populations as well. The calculations can be more complicated, and the results often depend on whether density dependence occurs in the larval stage (often modeled as density dependent reproduction) and/or other life stages. It has been shown that if density dependence only acts on larva, then there is an optimal life stage (size or age class) to harvest, with no harvest of all other life stages. Hence the optimal strategy is to harvest this most valuable life-stage at MSY. However, in age and stage-structured models, a constant MSY does not always exist. In such cases, cyclic harvest is optimal where the yield and resource fluctuate in size, through time. In addition, environmental stochasticity interacts with demographically structured populations in fundamentally different ways than for unstructured populations when determining optimal harvest. In fact, the optimal biomass to be left in the ocean, when fished at MSY, can be either higher or lower than in analogous deterministic models, depending on the details of the density dependent recruitment function, if stage-structure is also included in the model. \n",
      " Implications of MSY model \n",
      " Starting to harvest a previously unharvested population will always lead to a decrease in the population size. That is, it is impossible for a harvested population to remain at its original carrying capacity. Instead, the population will either stabilize at a new lower equilibrium size or, if the harvesting rate is too high, decline to zero. The reason why populations can be sustainably harvested is that they exhibit a density-dependent response. This means that at any population size below K, the population is producing a surplus yield that is available for harvesting without reducing population size. Density dependence is the regulator process that allows the population to return to equilibrium after a perturbation. The logistic equation assumes that density dependence takes the form of negative feedback. If a constant number of individuals is harvested from a population at a level greater than the MSY, the population will decline to extinction. Harvesting below the MSY level leads to a stable equilibrium population if the starting population is above the unstable equilibrium population size. \n",
      " Uses of MSY \n",
      " MSY has been especially influential in the management of renewable biological resources such as commercially important fish and wildlife. In fisheries terms, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is the largest average catch that can be captured from a stock under existing environmental conditions.National Research Council (NRC). 1998. Improving Fish Stock Assessments. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. MSY aims at a balance between too much and too little harvest to keep the population at some intermediate abundance with a maximum replacement rate. Relating to MSY, the maximum economic yield (MEY) is the level of catch that provides the maximum net economic benefits or profits to society.Clark, C.W. (1990), Mathematical Bioeconomics: The Optimal Management of Renewable Resources, 2nd ed. Wiley-Interscience, New YorkNational Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). 1996. OUr Living Oceans: Report on the Status of U.S. Living Marine Resources 1995. NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS0F/SPO-19. NMFS, Silver Springs, Md. Like optimum sustainable yield, MEY is usually less than MSY. \n",
      " Limitations of MSY approach \n",
      " Although it is widely practiced by state and federal government agencies regulating wildlife, forests, and fishing, MSY has come under heavy criticism by ecologists and others from both theoretical and practical reasons. The concept of maximum sustainable yield is not always easy to apply in practice. Estimation problems arise due to poor assumptions in some models and lack of reliability of the data.Townsend, C.R., Begon, M., and Harper, J.L. (2008), Essentials of Ecology Blackwell Publishing. Biologists, for example, do not always have enough data to make a clear determination of the population's size and growth rate. Calculating the point at which a population begins to slow from competition is also very difficult. The concept of MSY also tends to treat all individuals in the population as identical, thereby ignoring all aspects of population structure such as size or age classes and their differential rates of growth, survival, and reproduction. As a management goal, the static interpretation of MSY (i.e., MSY as a fixed catch that can be taken year after year) is generally not appropriate because it ignores the fact that fish populations undergo natural fluctuations (i.e., MSY treats the environment as unvarying) in abundance and will usually ultimately become severely depleted under a constant-catch strategy. Thus, most fisheries scientists now interpret MSY in a more dynamic sense as the maximum average yield (MAY) obtained by applying a specific harvesting strategy to a fluctuating resource. Or as an optimal \"escapement strategy\", where escapement means the amount of fish that must remain in the ocean [rather than the amount of fish that can be harvested]. An escapement strategy is often the optimal strategy for maximizing expected yield of a harvested, stochastically fluctuating population. However, the limitations of MSY, does not mean it performs worse than humans using their best intuitive judgment. Experiments using students in natural resource management classes suggest that people using their past experience, intuition, and best judgement to manage a fishery generate far less long term yield compared to a computer using an MSY calculation, even when that calculation comes from incorrect population dynamic models. For a more contemporary description of MSY and its calculation see \n",
      "= Orange roughy \n",
      "= An example of errors in estimating the population dynamics of a species occurred within the New Zealand Orange roughy fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the orange roughy lived a long time and had bred slowly (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted. \n",
      " Criticism \n",
      " The approach has been widely criticized as ignoring several key factors involved in fisheries management and has led to the devastating collapse of many fisheries. Among conservation biologists it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.Larkin PA (1977) \"An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield\" Transactions of the American Fisheries Society, 106: 1–11. \n",
      " Overfishing \n",
      " Across the world there is a crisis in the world's fisheries.sciencemag.org Worm, Boris, et. a;. \"Impacts of Biodiversity Loss on Ocean Ecosystem Services,\" Science, 3 November 2006. In recent yearsan accelerating decline has been observed in the productivity of many important fisheries.Christy, F.T., and Scott, A.D. (1965), The common Wealth in Ocean Fisheries, Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore Fisheries which have been devastated in recent times include (but are not limited to) the great whale fisheries, the Grand Bank fisheries of the western Atlantic, and the Peruvian anchovy fishery. Recent assessments by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the state of the world's fisheries indicate a levelling off of landings in the 1990s, at about 100 million tons.FAO, Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources, FAO Technical Paper 335 (1994). In addition, the composition of global catches has changed.Roberts, C. (2007), The Unnatural History of the Sea, Island Press. As fishers deplete larger, long-lived predatory fish species such as cod, tuna, shark, and snapper, they move down to the next level – to species that tend to be smaller, shorter-lived, and less valuable. Overfishing is a classic example of the tragedy of the commons. \n",
      " Optimum sustainable yield \n",
      " In population ecology and economics, optimum sustainable yield is the level of effort (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield. In environmental science, optimum sustainable yield is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield. \n",

      "What is the main difference between the nurturant parent model and the strict father model in 'Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think'? \n",
      " text: \n",
      " title: Moral Politics (book)\n",
      "Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think is a 1996 book by cognitive linguist George Lakoff. It argues that conservatives and liberals hold two different conceptual models of morality. Conservatives have a strict father model in which people are made good through self-discipline and hard work, everyone is taken care of by taking care of themselves. Liberals have a nurturant parent model in which everyone is taken care of by helping each other. The first edition of the book was published with the subtitle What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don't. \n",
      " The book \n",
      " Moral Politics has two different purposes. Lakoff uses the techniques of cognitive linguistics to attempt to better understand the mental frameworks that lie behind contemporary American politics, describing which mental concepts make up a \"liberal\", and which a \"conservative\". (What Lakoff means by these two terms is considered below.) And, in the last few chapters, he argues that \"liberal\" morals and politics are superior to \"conservative\" morals and politics. The book is intended as an objective study of the conceptual metaphors underlying conservative and liberal politics although the closing section is devoted to the author's personal views. Lakoff makes it clear however, that there is no such thing as an Objective study of politics, as politics is based in subjective morality. Lakoff wrote Moral Politics soon after the Republican Party's \"Contract With America\" takeover of Congress under the Clinton presidency, and his usage of the terms \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" is strongly influenced by how those labels were used in the 1994 elections, the former having much to do with the Democratic party and the latter with the Republican party; indeed, chapter 9, \"Moral Categories in Politics\", presents Hillary Clinton as a prototypical \"liberal\" and Newt Gingrich as a prototypical \"conservative\". (Lakoff actually puts this somewhat differently, suggesting that Clinton is the prototypical nemesis of conservatives, while Gingrich is the prototypical nemesis of liberals.) \n",
      " The central problems \n",
      " The major observations/assumptions and questions on which the book is founded include these: # There is one cluster of beliefs that most conservatives share (including some kind of condemnation of abortion, a positive emphasis on military spending, and a fixed-percentage income tax) and another cluster that most liberals share (including some kind of support for abortion, a negative emphasis on military spending, and a progressive income tax). What is the explanation for this clustering? What \"unifies each of the lists of moral priorities?\" \"Mix and match\" views seem comparatively rare. How come? # Liberals and conservatives usually not only disagree with one another but view the \"other side\" as largely incoherent. Many liberals, for example, see building more prisons as a completely ineffective and illogical solution to crime, while many conservatives view it as the obvious solution. Why can't the one side even begin to understand the other? # Why do liberals and conservatives tend to use the same words to mean different things? For example, a liberal might use the term \"big government\" to condemn the military, but, to a conservative, the term \"big government\" has nothing to do with the military, even though the military is a significant government institution. # Why do liberals and conservatives make different issues the focus of campaigns? For example, why did the Republican leaders emphasize \"family values\" so much in their 1994 campaign, and why was similar emphasis not made by Democrats? Don't liberals also have families and a moral framework for reasoning about families? \n",
      " The proposed solution: a metaphorical model \n",
      " Lakoff tries to resolve these difficulties through a model in which liberals and conservatives are shown to have different and contradictory worldviews. These worldviews are thought to conflict in a number of ways relevant to the understanding of politics. Nonetheless, Lakoff claims that all of these differences center around the two sides' respective understandings of a single concept - the ideal nuclear family. The family is central to Lakoff because he views the family as the most familiar model for Americans to understand the country; that is, Americans often metaphorically understand their country as a family, with the government corresponding to the parent(s) of the family and the individual citizens corresponding to the children. Thus, one's understanding of how a family is best organized will have direct implications for how the country should be governed. The progressive ideal conceptualization follows the model of the \"nurturant parent\" family, while the conservative's follows the model of the \"strict father\" family. Given the importance of these concepts in Moral Politics, it is important to consider their meaning, along with how each view suggests and is justified by a corresponding view of the nature of child rearing, morality, and justice. A \"nurturant parent\" family is one that revolves around every family member caring for and being cared for by every other family member, with open communication between all parties, and with each family member pursuing their own vision of happiness. The nurturant parent model is also correlated with the following views: * Morality: The basis of morality is in understanding, respecting, and helping other people, and in seeking the happiness of one's self and of others. The primary vices are selfishness and anti-social behavior. * Child development: Children develop morality primarily through interacting with and observing good people, especially good parents. Punishment is necessary in some cases, but also has the potential to backfire, causing children to adopt more violent or more anti-social ways. Though children should, in general, obey their parents, they will develop best if allowed to question their parents' decisions, to hear justifications for their parents' rules, and so on. Moral development is a lifelong process, and almost no one is so perfect as not to need improvement. * Justice: The world is not without justice, but it is far from the ideal of justice. Many people, for example, do not seem properly rewarded for their hard work and dedication. We must work hard to improve everyone's condition. In contrast, the \"strict father\" family revolves around the idea that parents teach their children how to be self-reliant and self-disciplined through \"tough love\". This is correlated with the following views: * Morality: Evil is all around us, constantly tempting us. Thus, the basis of morality is strong moral character, which requires self-reliance and self-discipline. The primary vices are those that dissolve self-discipline, such as laziness, gluttony, and indulgent sexuality. * Child development: Children develop self-discipline, self- reliance, and other virtues primarily through rewards and punishment, a system of \"tough love\". Since parents know the difference between right and wrong and children still do not, obedience to the parents is very important. Moral development basically lasts only as long as childhood; it's important to get it right the first time, because there is no \"second chance\". * Justice: The world may be a difficult place to live, but it is basically just; people usually get what they deserve. The difficulties in one's life serve as a test to sort the deserving from the undeserving. Lakoff uses this model to answer the central questions framed above - why is there such clear grouping on issues that separate liberals and conservatives, and, conversely, why don't we find more issue-by-issue voters? Lakoff claims that one's take on any given political issue is largely determined by which model one adopts. Thus, in Part IV, \"The Hard Issues\", he tries to demonstrate how the liberal and conservative worldviews outlined above lead to typical liberal and conservative positions on a wide range of issues, including taxes, the death penalty, environmental regulations, affirmative action, education, and abortion. As to why liberals and conservatives view each other as incomprehensible on an issue-by-issue basis, Lakoff claims that this is due to each side failing to grasp the other side's worldview as well as not appreciating how different the other worldview is from its own. Failure to see or appreciate this gap results in both sides thinking the other is hopelessly irrational and immoral. Lakoff also uses this model to show how and why liberals and conservatives use different semantics, often even using the same words in very different ways. Liberals and conservatives have different worldviews and semantics are very much influenced by the worldview of the speaker. As Lakoff puts it, :Words don't have meanings in isolation. Words are defined relative to a conceptual system. If liberals are to understand how conservatives use their words, they will have to understand the conservative conceptual system. (From chapter 2, \"The Worldview Problem\") Here, Lakoff is specifically referring to liberals' challenges in understanding conservatives. However, he obviously views the reverse situation as equally problematic. In addressing why conservatives and liberals choose different issues as the focus of their campaigns, Lakoff claims that this too finds explanation in the context of his model. In the 1994 elections, the Republican focus on \"family values\", while the Democrats largely ignored this framing, is key to Lakoff. He views this discrepancy as a sign that conservatives understand the Country is a Family metaphor that lies behind people's views of politics much better than liberals do. And, by extension, this has been key to the success of the Republican Party. \n",
      " Clarifications of the model \n",
      " There are several things Lakoff does not intend to mean with his model. Perhaps most importantly, he does not believe that all conservatives are the same, nor all liberals. Chapter 17, \"Varieties of Liberals and Conservatives\", is devoted to showing scales along which one can slide and still be a member of either camp. Among other things, he says that one might have one way to conceptualize an actual nuclear family, and a separate, even opposite, way of conceptualizing a metaphorical country-family. Lakoff is not trying to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for being liberal or conservative. In the terminology of cognitive linguistics, Lakoff views both liberal and conservative as \"radial category\" labels. Lakoff does not feel people consciously believe in the family concepts he describes. As a cognitive scientist, he believes he is describing mental structures that are mostly below the level of consciousness. A tenet of cognitive psychology is that such mental structures affect one's opinions and consequent actions. \n",
      " Arguments against shallow stereotypes \n",
      " Lakoff is opposed to superficial, stereotypical and false characterizing of both liberals and conservatives. The book addresses common oversimplifications about both worldviews. In chapter 7, \"Why We Need a New Understanding of American Politics\", Lakoff refutes several conceptions of \"Conservatism\" that he views as too simplistic. He says that any liberal or conservative saying that \"Conservatives just believe in less government\" is incorrect. Common misconceptions that liberals hold include that Conservatism is \"the ethos of selfishness\" and \"is no more than a conspiracy of the ultrarich to protect their money and power and to make themselves even richer and more powerful.\" Common misunderstandings of conservatives by conservatives are that \"Conservatism (and nothing else) is for traditional values\", and that \"Conservatism is just what the Bible tells us.\" In chapter 18, \"Pathologies, Stereotypes, and Distortions\", he refutes certain stereotyped views of liberals, including viewing them as \"lovers of bureaucracy\", \"defenders of special interests\" and \"advocating only rights and no responsibilities\" (p. 317, 1996 edition). \n",
      " The importance of metaphors \n",
      " Lakoff argues that people tend to think metaphorically, reasoning through analogy rather than logic. Metaphors are prevalent in communication and we do not just use them in language; we actually perceive and act in accordance with metaphors. Conceptual metaphors shape not just our communication, but also the way we think and act. As a cognitive scientist Lakoff emphasizes that what conservatives know that liberals don't is how to use metaphors to motivate people. Liberals try to persuade through reason and facts while conservatives used metaphorical stories and that is why, Lakoff argues, conservative politicians are more successful at motivating voters than liberals are. \n",
      " Second edition \n",
      " The book's subtitle changed between the first and the current edition. Previously titled Moral Politics: What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don't, it has been rechristened Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think. The original subtitle reflected Lakoff's idea that conservatives, at least 1994 conservatives, understood the nature of American politics better than liberals. In particular, he felt conservatives better understood the metaphorical connection between the family, morality and politics; and, especially around 1994, were able to gain votes by using persuasive metaphors, whilst liberals employed logic and reason. Within this framework, the original subtitle can be seen as a call-to-arms to liberals to gain understanding of how people actually think about politics, or face growing electoral irrelevance. The bulk of the second edition text is identical to that of the first. All that is added is a second edition preface, and a 37-page afterword relating the book's content to the 2000 US presidential election. \n",
      " Application \n",
      " \n",
      " Howard Dean \n",
      " Presidential candidate Howard Dean is a fan of the book, citing it as support for his activist strategy. \"What you do is crank the heck out of your base, get them really excited and crank up the base turnout and you'll win the middle-of-the- roaders,\" Dean told U.S. News & World Report. Dean reasoned that since swing voters share the mental model of both parties they will eventually go with whatever party excites them the most. \"Democrats appeal to them on their softer side--the safety net--but the Republicans appeal to them on the harder side--the discipline, the responsibility, and so forth. So the question is which side appears to be energetic, deeply believing in its message, deeply committed to bringing a vision of hope to America. That side is the side that gets the swing voters and wins.\" While Dean lost the 2004 Presidential Democratic primary, he has been successful in other political and activist arenas. First, he was the governor of Vermont, and later the front-runner in a crowded primary race although his campaign was staffed mostly by students and non-professional political staff. Dean later formed the activist organization Democracy for America and later was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee (leader of the Democratic party) in February 2005. Dean's activism is widely credited with reviving the activist base of the Democratic Party. Dean later wrote the introduction to a related but shorter book by Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate. \n",

The concept is also often extended to related phenomena, for example, incongruent dissolution of a solid by a liquid solvent, which is often encountered in geology. The term \"phase decomposition\" is sometimes used to describe incongruent transition. However, it has to be kept in mind that incongruent transition is described by an equilibrium.

Such complexes are further subdivided according to the planarity or pyramidalization at sulfur. The various bonding modes are: *η1-SO2, planar (meaning that the MSO2 subunit forms a plane). In such complexes, SO2 is classified as a 2e donor complemented by pi-back bonding into the empty pz orbital localized on sulfur. *η1-SO2, pyramidal (meaning that the MSO2 subunit is pyramidal at sulfur). In such complexes, SO2 is classified as a pure Lewis acid. The structure is similar to that for conventional Lewis base adducts of SO2. *η2-SO2. Both S and one O centre are attached to the metal.

In such cases, SO2 attaches to a metal via one of its two oxygen centres. Such complexes are prevalent for hard metal cations such as Na+ and Al3+. In these compounds the M-O interaction is usually weak. More exotic bonding modes are known for clusters. : \n",
      "Preparation\n",
      " Complexes of the transition metals are usually generated simply by treating the appropriate metal complex with SO2. The adducts are often weak. In some cases, SO2 displaces other ligands. A large number of labile O-bonded SO2 complexes arise from the oxidation of a suspension of the metals in liquid SO2, an excellent solvent. \n",
      "Reactions\n",
      " The main reaction of sulfur dioxide promoted by transition metals is its reduction by hydrogen sulfide. Known as the Claus process, this reaction is conducted on a large scale as a way to remove hydrogen sulfide that arises in hydrotreating processes in refineries. \n",
      "Insertion of SO2 into metal-ligand bonds\n",
      " Of academic interest, SO2 acts like a Lewis acid towards the alkyl ligand. The pathway for the insertion of SO2 into metal alkyl bond begins with attack of the alkyl nucleophile on the sulfur centre in SO2. The \"insertion\" proceed the sulfur dioxide between the metal and the alkyl ligand leads to the O, O'-sulphinate. Alternatively an O-sulphinate can arise. Both of these intermediates commonly convert to an S-sulphinate. S-sulphinate has sulfur- oxygen stretching frequencies from 1250–1000 cm−1 and 1100–1000 cm−1. The O, O'-sulphinate and O-sulphinate are difficult to distinguish as they have stretching frequencies from 1085–1050 cm−1 and 1000–820 cm−1 or lower. The pathway involving the O, O' sulphinate can generally be ruled out if the original metal complex fulfilled the 18-electron rule because the two metal- oxygen bonds would exceed the 18 electron rule. The pathway by which SO2 inserts into a square planar alkyl complexes involves the formation of an adduct. Thereafter, the alkyl ligand migrates to the SO2. thumb|center|400px|Pathway for insertion of SO2 into Au-methyl bonds of a square planar Au(III)) complex. \n",

      "What is the explanatory gap in the philosophy of mind and consciousness? \n",
      " text: \n",
      " title: Explanatory gap\n",
      "In the philosophy of mind and consciousness, the explanatory gap is the difficulty that physicalist philosophies have in explaining how physical properties give rise to the way things feel subjectively when they are experienced. It is a term introduced by philosopher Joseph Levine. In the 1983 paper in which he first used the term, he used as an example the sentence, \"Pain is the firing of C fibers\", pointing out that while it might be valid in a physiological sense, it does not help us to understand how pain feels. The explanatory gap has vexed and intrigued philosophers and AI researchers alike for decades and caused considerable debate. Bridging this gap (that is, finding a satisfying mechanistic explanation for experience and qualia) is known as \"the hard problem\".David Chalmers, Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness, JCS, 2 (3), 1995 , pp. 200–19. An example of a phenomenon in which there is no gap is a modern computer's behavior, which can be adequately explained by its physical components alone, such as its circuitry and software. In contrast, it is thought by many mind-body dualists (e.g. René Descartes, David Chalmers) that subjective conscious experience constitutes a separate effect that demands another cause that is either outside the physical world (dualism) or due to an as yet unknown physical phenomenon (see for instance quantum mind, indirect realism). Proponents of dualism claim that the mind is substantially and qualitatively different from the brain and that the existence of something metaphysically extra-physical is required to \"fill the gap\". Similarly, some argue that there are further facts—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts of the world—about conscious experience. For example, they argue that what it is like to experience seeing red does not follow logically from the physical facts of the world. \n",
      " Implications \n",
      " The nature of the explanatory gap is disputed. Some consider it to be simply a limit on our current explanatory ability.Dennett, D. C. 1991. Consciousness Explained. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. They argue that future findings in neuroscience or future work from philosophers could close the gap. Others argue that the gap is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities as humans—no amount of further information will allow us to close it.McGinn, C. 1989. “Can we solve the mind-body problem?” Mind, 98: 349–66 There is no consensus about what metaphysical conclusions the existence of the gap provides. Those who use its existence to support dualism have often taken the position that an epistemic gap—particularly if it is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities—necessarily entails a metaphysical gap.Chalmers, D. 1996. The Conscious Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Levine and others opt to either remain silent on the matter or argue that no such metaphysical conclusion should be drawn.Levine, J. 1983. “Materialism and qualia: the explanatory gap”. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 64: 354–361. He agrees that conceivability (as used in the Zombie and inverted spectrum arguments) is flawed as a means of establishing metaphysical realities; but argues that even if we come to the metaphysical conclusion that qualia are physical, they still present an explanatory problem. > While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not > suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability > considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the > body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical > properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the > mental in terms of the physical.J. Levine, \"Conceivability, Identity, and > the Explanatory Gap\" in Stuart R. Hameroff, Alfred W. Kaszniak and David > Chalmers (eds.), Towards a Science of Consciousness III: The Third Tucson > Discussions and Debates, The MIT Press, 1999, pp 3–12. However, such an epistemological or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, even if not proven by conceivability arguments, is far from ruled out. > In the end, we are right back where we started. The explanatory gap argument > doesn't demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of > nature. Of course, a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our > understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature. But so > long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter, we have to > look elsewhere for an explanation of the former. At the core of the problem, according to Levine, is our lack of understanding of what it means for a qualitative experience to be fully comprehended. He emphasizes that we do not even know to what extent it is appropriate to inquire into the nature of this kind of experience. He uses the laws of gravity as an example, which laws seem to explain gravity completely yet do not account for the gravitational constant. Similarly to the way in which gravity appears to be an inexplicable brute fact of nature, the case of qualia may be one in which we are either lacking essential information or in which we are exploring a natural phenomenon that simply is not further apprehensible. Levine suggests that for this reason perhaps we should consider whether it is necessary to find a more complete explanation of qualitative experience. Levine points out that understanding how much there is to be known about qualitative experience seems even more difficult because we lack a way to articulate what it means for actualities to be knowable in the manner that he has in mind. He concludes that there are good reasons to want a more complete explanation of qualitative experiences. One is that consciousness appears to manifest only where mentality is demonstrated in physical systems that are quite highly organized. Levine argues that it seems counterintuitive to accept this implication that the human brain, so highly organized as it is, could be no more than a routine executor. He notes that while materialism appears to entail reducibility of anything that is not physically primary to an explanation of its dependence on a mechanism that can be described in terms of physical fundamentals, that kind of reductionism does not attempt to reduce psychology to physical science. However, it still entails that there are inexplicable classes of facts which are not treated as relevant to statements pertinent to psychology. Many philosophers have doubted that the explanatory gap can be solved. As proponents of the argument use it to support arguments against materialism, physicalism, and naturalism, its arguments appear to resist any scientific or philosophical solution to the problem. David Chalmers acknowledged that even when science bridges the gap to some degree, the problem will persist. \n",

      " title: The Making of the Representative for Planet 8\n",
      "The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 is a 1982 science fiction novel by Doris Lessing. It is the fourth book in her five-book Canopus in Argos series and relates the fate of a planet, under the care of the benevolent galactic empire Canopus, that is plunged into an ice age. It was first published in the United States in January 1982 by Alfred A. Knopf, and in the United Kingdom in March 1982 by Jonathan Cape. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of The New York Times wrote in a review of this book that \"the effect of the story is powerful and immediate – with all the drama of good polar-exploration literature, and the eloquence, at its best, of the King James Bible.\" However, John Leonard, also of The New York Times, was critical of Lessing's switch to science fiction and in a review of this book, complained that \"Mrs. Lessing is no longer very interested in people. She has come to feel that individuality is a 'degenerative disease'... She seems ... to be in the process of junking not only traditional narrative and conventional characters but the details of feeling as well...\" The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 can be read as a stand-alone book, although it does make reference to the planet Shikasta, introduced in the first book of the Canopus series. \n",
      "Plot\n",
      " Planet 8 is a small world that was colonised by the benevolent galactic empire Canopus and populated with a new species created from the stock of four different species originating on several other Canopean planets. Planet 8 has a warm temperate climate and, under Canopus's skilled guidance, the inhabitants live comfortably and at peace with themselves and their world. One day Canopus instructs them to build a huge wall, to exact Canopean specifications, right around the girth of the planet. The construction takes the inhabitants years to complete, and when it is finished, Canopus tells the planet's representatives, leaders of each of the planet's main disciplines, to relocate all settlements north of the wall to the south. Canopus informs everyone that unfortunate interstellar \"re-alignments\" have taken place and that Planet 8 will soon experience an ice age. After a while temperatures start to drop and the climate begins to change. Glaciers form in the north and slowly advance towards the wall. Canopus, however, assures Planet 8 that Canopus has a new home for them, a peaceful and prosperous world called Rohanda (the subject of the first book in this series, Shikasta), and that when it has reached a certain level of development, Canopus will space-lift the inhabitants of Planet 8 to Rohanda. This fills the people of Planet 8 with hope as they are forced to adapt their lifestyles to cope with this new and unfamiliar climate. By the time the glaciers reach the wall, much of the vegetation in the south has been destroyed by snow and ice and conditions grow worse. Conflict breaks out amongst the erstwhile peaceful villagers as food becomes scarce. But the wall holds the glaciers back and the people still remain resolute in their faith that Canopus will rescue them. Then Canopean agent Johor (first introduced in Shikasta) arrives on Planet 8 with the devastating news that disaster has struck Rohanda: it has been renamed Shikasta (the stricken) and is no longer available for re-settlement. But Johor does not leave Planet 8. He remains to endure the hardships with the villagers and does what he can to help them face their inevitable demise. In time, when the population is now faced with starvation, the wall, which was only a temporary barrier, gives way and the glaciers start over-running settlements in the south. The senior representatives, at a loss as to what to do, head north over the wall and onto the glacier. Johor travels with them as they try to reach the pole, but they soon all succumb to cold and hunger. Their physical bodies perish, but their \"beings\" rise and merge into a single consciousness that becomes the Representative for Planet 8 and all its memories. After watching Planet 8 freeze over completely, the Representative departs for a place \"where Canopus tends and guards and instructs.\" \n",

      "Afterword\n",
      " The book contains a 30-page afterword in which Lessing states that The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 and the previous book in this series, The Sirian Experiments were inspired by her 50-year fascination in the ill-fated 1910–13 Antarctic expedition of Robert Falcon Scott, though not, she points out, by the element of ice and polar conditions in itself. Lessing expresses a concern that Scott and his explorers, heroes in their day, were vilified by recent generations. She analyses the disastrous expedition and the changes as to how it, and Scott himself, have been viewed by posterity, and discusses these changes in the popular views of the journey in connection with the changing fashions of thought and the decline of imperialist ideas. The efforts of Scott and his men, she concludes, should be understood as a deliberate wager with destiny rather than a scientific project: they tried to transcend themselves by taking on responsibilities they knew they might not be fully equipped for or experienced enough to handle, which ultimately cost many of them their lives. Lessing explicitly likens this view of the pride in sacrifice and self-transcending to the expectations and propaganda imagery of the First World War soon after. \n",
      "Adaptations\n",
      " *The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (opera, 1986) The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 was adapted for the opera in 1986 by composer Philip Glass with story-libretto by Doris Lessing. The three-act opera, for orchestra, small chorus and soloists was commissioned by the Houston Grand Opera, the English National Opera and the Landestheater Kiel in Germany. It first premiered on 8 July 1988 at the Houston Grand Opera in Houston, Texas. The British premiere was on 9 November 1988 by the English National Opera at the London Coliseum. The premiere received a lukewarm review by New York Times music critic John Rockwell. In 1997, Glass adapted another of Lessing's books from this series for the opera, The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five. \n",

      " title: Alfred I. Tauber\n",
      "Alfred I. Tauber (born 1947) is an American philosopher and historian of science, who, from 1993 to 2010, served as director of the Boston University Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University. Tauber has published extensively on 19th and 20th century biomedicine, the development of modern immunology, the doctor-patient relationship, and contemporary science studies. He is the 2008 recipient of the Science Medal from the University of Bologna in Bologna, Italy, and Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa from the University of Haifa in Haifa, Israel, in 2011. Since 2013 he has been chairman of the board of governors of the University of Haifa. \n",
      " Research \n",
      " Tauber's key publications fall into three areas: He published the first philosophical study of contemporary immunology, The Immune Self: Theory or Metaphor? (Cambridge 1994), which became the second monograph of a quartet tracing the theoretical development of this science. In these works and various critical papers he has argued that the prevailing self/nonself paradigm inadequately models immune tolerance and over-emphasizes host defense at the expense of cooperative ecological relationships. By advocating a cognitive view of immune functions, he presents physiological autoimmunity and symbiotic relationships as alternate immune frameworks for modeling normal immunity. His Immunity: The Evolution of an Idea (Oxford 2017) summarizes this interpretation. In medical ethics, Tauber has focused on the doctor-patient relationship: In Confessions of a Medicine Man (MIT 1999), he promoted the foundational status of the ethics of medicine and thus firmly placed science and technology in the employ of the moral mandate of health care. Patient Autonomy and the Ethics of Responsibility (MIT Press 2005) extended this argument with a description of \"relational autonomy\" to define the moral status of the patient, coupled with advocacy of patient-centered medicine. His third area of interest has centered on the replacement of reified notions of science with an epistemology thoroughly melded with human-centered interests and intentions. In seeking a comprehensive understanding of scientific practice and application, Tauber argues for a \"moral epistemology\", a philosophy that builds upon the collapse of the fact/value distinction to define the interplay of various values in the diversity of science's methodologies and interpretations. More specifically, he is concerned with the nature of knowing that translates objective knowledge into personal meaning. His Thoreau and the Moral Agency of Knowing (California 2001) illustrates the composite character of personal identity that such an approach presents, one in which moral agency broadly defines personal identity. These studies have been extended in critiques of psychoanalytic portrayals of the ego that place Freud in imagined dialogues with philosophers of his own era in Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher (Princeton 2010) and with Adorno, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein in Requiem for the Ego (Stanford 2013). While primarily teaching and writing in science studies and bioethics, Tauber originally trained as a biochemist and hematologist and has published over 125 research publications in biochemistry and cell biology. Since 2004, Tauber has held a part-time visiting professorship at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he teaches in the Cohn Institute for the History of Science and Ideas. \n",

      "According to Max Weber, which type of authority is the most advanced? \n",
      " text: \n",
      " title: Tripartite classification of authority\n",
      "Max Weber distinguished three ideal types of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority. He wrote about these three types of domination in both his essay \"The Three Types of Legitimate Rule\", which was published in his masterwork Economy and Society (see Weber 1922/1978:215-216), and in his classic speech \"Politics as a Vocation\" (see Weber 1919/2015:137-138). # charismatic authority (character, heroism, leadership, religious), # traditional authority (patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism) and # rational- legal authority (modern law and state, bureaucracy). These three types are ideal types and rarely appear in their pure form. According to Weber, authority is power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. These three forms of authority are said to appear in an \"hierarchical development order\". States progress from charismatic authority, to traditional authority, and finally reach the state of rational-legal authority which is characteristic of a modern liberal democracy. \n",
      "Charismatic authority\n",
      " Charismatic authority grows out of the personal charm or the strength of an individual personality.Charismatic Leadership (Weber) It was described by Weber in a lecture as \"the authority of the extraordinary and personal gift of grace (charisma)\"; he distinguished it from the other forms of authority by stating \"Men do not obey him [the charismatic ruler] by virtue of tradition or statute, but because they believe in him.\"Politics as a Vocation Thus the actual power or capabilities of the leader are irrelevant, as long as the followers believe that such power exists. Thus, according to Weber, it is particularly difficult for charismatic leaders to maintain their authority because the followers must continue to legitimize the authority of the leader. Officials consist of those who have shown personal devotion to the ruler, and of those who possess their own charisma. Charismatic authority is different from legal-rational and traditional power insofar as it does not develop from established tradition but rather from the belief the followers have in the leader. According to Weber, once the leader loses his charisma or dies, systems based on charismatic authority tend to transform into traditional or legal-rational systems. \n",
      "Traditional authority\n",
      " In systems based around traditional authority, legitimacy comes from tradition or custom, even the nominal personal ruler(s) being subject to it; Weber described it as \"the authority of the eternal yesterday\" and identified it as the source of authority for monarchies. In this type of domination, the traditional rights of a powerful individual or group are accepted by the subordinate, or at least not challenged. The dominant individual could be a clan leader, eldest, the head of a family, a patriarchal figure or dominant elite. Officials consist either of personal retainers (in a patrimonial regime) or of personal loyal allies, such as vassals or tributary lords (in a feudal regime). Their prerogatives are usually similar to those of the ruler above them, just reduced in scale, and they too are often selected based on inheritance.Reinhard Bendix, Max Weber: an intellectual portrait, University of California Press, 1977, p.295 Historically this has been the most common type of government. According to Weber, inequalities are created and preserved by traditional authority. Should this authority not be challenged, the dominant leader or group will stay in power. For Weber, traditional power blocked the development of rational-legal authority. \n",
      "Rational-legal authority\n",
      " Legal authority, also known as rational-legal authority, is based on a system of rules that is applied administratively and judicially in accordance with known principles. The persons who administer those rules are appointed or elected by legal procedures. Superiors are also subject to rules that limit their powers, separate their private lives from official duties and require written documentation.Reinhard Bendix, Max Weber: an intellectual portrait, University of California Press, 1977, p.294 It is the authority that demands obedience to the office rather than the officeholder; once a leader leaves office, their rational-legal authority is lost. Weber identified \"rationally-created rules\" as the central feature of this form of authority. Modern democracies contain many examples of legal-rational regimes. There are different ways in which legal authority can develop. Many societies have developed a system of laws and regulations and there exist many different principles of legality. With the development of a legal-rational system, the political system is likely to be rationalized similarly. Constitutions, written documents, established offices and regular elections are often associated with modern legal-rational political systems. These in the past have tended to develop in opposition to earlier traditional systems such as monarchies, where the set of rules are not well developed. As these systems develop in a rational manner, authority takes on a legal-rational form. Those who govern have the legitimate legal right to do so and those subordinated accept the legality of the rulers. Albeit rational-legal authority may be challenged by those subordinated, it is unlikely to result in a quick change in the nature of the system. Such power struggles, according to Weber, are mostly political struggles and may be based on nationalism or ethnicity. \n",
      "The classification of authority in the context of history\n",
      " Weber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones, because the instability of charismatic authority inevitably forces it to \"routinize\" into a more structured form of authority. Likewise he notes that in a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a master can lead to a \"traditional revolution\". Thus he alludes to an inevitable move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilizing a bureaucratic structure. This ties to his broader concept of rationalization by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social evolutionism theory. In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition, in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual (charisma), and in legal (or rational-legal) authority from powers that are bureaucratically and legally attached to certain positions. A classic example of these three types may be found in religion: priests (traditional), Jesus (charismatic), and the Roman Catholic Church (legal-rational). Weber also conceived of these three types within his three primary modes of conflict: traditional authority within status groups, charismatic authority within class, and legal-rational authority within party organizations. In his view every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained elements that can be analyzed on the basis of the above distinction. \n",
