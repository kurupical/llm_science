Four population risk groups are included, along with assumptions about sexual behaviour, rates of infection, conception rates, the median duration to mortality of those with HIV/AIDS, and the rates of transmission between mother and child. The impact of drug treatments at birth and while nursing, enhanced STD treatment, and risk avoidance is projected by a lower rate scenario The model makes provisions for migration of the population, separate modeling of racial groups, and separate modeling of provincial populations.

      "The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is a Japanese remote sensing instrument onboard the Terra satellite launched by NASA in 1999. It has been collecting data since February 2000. ASTER provides high-resolution images of Earth in 14 different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from visible to thermal infrared light. The resolution of images ranges between 15 and 90 meters. ASTER data is used to create detailed maps of surface temperature of land, emissivity, reflectance, and elevation. In April 2008, the SWIR detectors of ASTER began malfunctioning and were publicly declared non-operational by NASA in January 2009. All SWIR data collected after 1 April 2008 has been marked as unusable. The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) is available at no charge to users worldwide via electronic download. As of 2 April 2016, the entire catalogue of ASTER image data became publicly available online at no cost.

      "Version 1\n",
      " On 29 June 2009, the Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) was released to the public. A joint operation between NASA and Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the Global Digital Elevation Model is the most complete mapping of the earth ever made, covering 99% of its surface. The previous most comprehensive map, NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, covered approximately 80% of the Earth's surface, with a global resolution of 90 meters, and a resolution of 30 meters over the USA. The GDEM covers the planet from 83 degrees North to 83 degrees South (surpassing SRTM's coverage of 56 °S to 60 °N), becoming the first earth mapping system that provides comprehensive coverage of the polar regions. It was created by compiling 1.3 million VNIR images taken by ASTER using single-pass stereoscopic correlation techniques, with terrain elevation measurements taken globally at 30-meter (98 ft) intervals. Despite the high nominal resolution, however, some reviewers have commented that the true resolution is considerably lower, and not as good as that of SRTM data, and serious artifacts are present. Some of these limitations have been confirmed by METI and NASA, who point out that the version 1 of the GDEM product is \"research grade\". \n",
      "Version 2\n",
      " During October 2011, version 2 of Global Digital Elevation Model was publicly released. This is considered an improvement upon version 1. These improvements include increased horizontal and vertical accuracy, better horizontal resolution, reduced presence of artifacts, and more realistic values over water bodies. However, one reviewer still regards the Aster version 2 dataset, although showing 'a considerable improvement in the effective level of detail', to still be regarded as 'experimental or research grade' due to presence of artefacts. A 2014 study showed that over rugged mountainous terrain the ASTER version 2 data set can be a more accurate representation of the ground than the SRTM elevation model. \n",
      "Version 3\n",
      " ASTER v3 was released on August 5, 2019. The improved GDEM V3 adds additional stereo-pairs, improving coverage and reducing the occurrence of artifacts. The refined production algorithm provides improved spatial resolution, increased horizontal and vertical accuracy. The ASTER GDEM V3 maintains the GeoTIFF format and the same gridding and tile structure as V1 and V2, with 30-meter postings and 1 x 1 degree tiles. Version 3 is claimed to have significant improvements over the previous release. Automated processing of 2.3 million scenes from the ASTER archive was used to create the ASTER GDEM, which included stereo-correlation to create individual scene-based ASTER DEMs, masking to remove cloudy pixels, stacking all cloud-screened DEMs, removing residual bad values and outliers, averaging selected data to create final pixel values. *Ground sample distance *Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) \n",

An imaging system may have many individual components, including one or more lenses, and/or recording and display components. Each of these contributes (given suitable design, and adequate alignment) to the optical resolution of the system; the environment in which the imaging is done often is a further important factor. ==Lateral resolution== Resolution depends on the distance between two distinguishable radiating points. The sections below describe the theoretical estimates of resolution, but the real values may differ. The results below are based on mathematical models of Airy discs, which assumes an adequate level of contrast. In low-contrast systems, the resolution may be much lower than predicted by the theory outlined below.

      "Angular resolution describes the ability of any image-forming device such as an optical or radio telescope, a microscope, a camera, or an eye, to distinguish small details of an object, thereby making it a major determinant of image resolution. It is used in optics applied to light waves, in antenna theory applied to radio waves, and in acoustics applied to sound waves. The colloquial use of the term \"resolution\" sometimes causes confusion; when an optical system is said to have a high resolution or high angular resolution, it means that the perceived distance, or actual angular distance, between resolved neighboring objects is small. The value that quantifies this property, θ, which is given by the Rayleigh criterion, is low for a system with a high resolution. The closely related term spatial resolution refers to the precision of a measurement with respect to space, which is directly connected to angular resolution in imaging instruments.

The resolution of an optical imaging system a microscope, telescope, or camera can be limited by factors such as imperfections in the lenses or misalignment. However, there is a principal limit to the resolution of any optical system, due to the physics of diffraction. An optical system with resolution performance at the instrument's theoretical limit is said to be diffraction- limited. The diffraction-limited angular resolution, in radians, of an instrument is proportional to the wavelength of the light being observed, and inverse\n",

      "answer: title: Alicia Partnoy\n",
      "Alicia Mabel Partnoy (born 1955 in Bahía Blanca, Argentina) is a human rights activist, poet, college professor, and translator. After Argentinian President Juan Perón died, the students from the left of the Peronist political party organized with fervor within the country's universities and, along with workers, were persecuted and imprisoned. There was a military coup in 1976 and people began to disappear. Partnoy was one of those who suffered through the ordeals of becoming a political prisoner. She became an activist of the Peronist Youth Movement while attending Southern National University (see Education). She was taken from her home, leaving behind her 18-month-old daughter, on January 12, 1977, by the Argentinian Army and imprisoned at a concentration camp named The Little School (La Escuelita). For three and a half months, Partnoy was blindfolded. She was brutally beaten, starved, molested, and forced to live in inhuman conditions. She was moved from the concentration camp to the prison of Villa Floresta in Bahía Blanca where she stayed for six months only to be transferred to Villa Devoto prison in Buenos Aires. She spent two and a half years as a prisoner of conscience, with no charges. In 1979, she was forced to leave the country, coming to the U.S. as a refugee with her daughter where they were reunited with her husband in Seattle, Washington. In 1985, she told her story of what had happened to her at The Little School in an eponymous book. The world began to open its eyes to the treatment of women in reference to the disappearances of Latin Americans. Alicia Partnoy has testified before the United Nations, the Organization of American States, Amnesty International, and the Argentine Human Rights Commission. Her testimony is recorded in a compilation of testimonials by the National Commission for the Investigation of the Disappeared.

      "Await Further Instructions is a 2018 British science fiction horror film directed by Johnny Kevorkian. The film follows a dysfunctional family who winds up entrapped in their house on Christmas by a mysterious black membrane and begins receiving cryptic instructions from their television. \n",
      " Plot \n",
      " The film centers upon a family who have gathered for Christmas. The family is made up of Nick, his girlfriend Annji, Nick's pregnant sister Kate, Kate's husband Scott, Grandad, and Nick's parents Tony and Beth. The gathering is initially fine but grows tense after Kate makes racist remarks to Annji. They quickly find that they are surrounded by a strange black substance and that they cannot flee the home. They receive messages warning them that their food is contaminated and instructing them to cleanse themselves with bleach, as well as take a vaccine dropped down their chimney. Tony forces the family to take the vaccines despite Annji's reservations, as the syringes look used. Grandad dies while vomiting black liquid. The television later informs the family that one of their number is infected. Tony, Beth, Kate, and Scott believe it to be Annji, so they lock her in an upstairs bedroom with the dead body of Grandad. Nick unplugs the television, but is warned against this once it's plugged back in by Tony. Kate urges Scott to attack Nick, only for her to become injured in the process. A desperate Nick tries to secretly find a way to flee the home, only for the television to reveal this to the others. By attaching a phone to a long stick with which to probe the space where the toilet waste pipe leaves the house, Nick has obtained film of some snakelike entity attacking the phone. Tony and Scott rush in, knock Nick unconscious, and drag him downstairs. The television then tells them that Nick is a sleeper agent and that they must get information from him. Tony refuses to look at the phone footage and tortures Nick until Beth interrupts them to let them know that Kate has died. The surviving family members are told to return to the first floor as the television is activating quarantine. Nick is able to get Annji downstairs, but is unable to save his mother, who dies after exposure to black smoke. Nick and Annji rush downstairs and find the TV displaying a bright light, and Nick unplugs the TV. The light stays on the TV, however, and the house begins shaking. The TV proclaims that it is being resurrected just before Nick passes out. Nick awakens to find that he and Annji have been restrained and that the television wants Scott and Tony to sacrifice them. Tony attempts to sacrifice Annji, but Nick and Scott attack him, and Tony murders Scott with an axe. A fight between Tony and Nick ends when Nick throws the TV onto Tony, killing him. The TV rights itself and wire-like tendrils snake out of the TV and enter Tony via the back of his head and take control of his body. They soon realize that the black substance is composed entirely of the living wires. Nick confronts the wires, and throws the axe into the \"heart\" inside the TV. The tendrils seemingly die, but soon begin moving and engulf them. Tony, being controlled by the wires, murders them with the axe. The tendrils digest Kate's body, leaving only her skeletal remains and her still-living baby amidst them. Tony brings in another TV, which greets the baby as \"Ruby\" and displays colorful patterns to get her attention. By this point, it turns out that television media itself has gained sapience and wants humanity to worship it as a god. \n",

      "answer: title: Alexander's law\n",
      "Alexander's law refers to gaze-evoked nystagmus that occurs after an acute unilateral vestibular loss. It was first described in 1912 and has three elements to explain how the vestibulo-ocular reflex responds to an acute vestibular insult. The first element says that spontaneous nystagmus after an acute vestibular impairment has the fast phase directed toward the healthy ear. The direction of the nystagmus, by convention, is named for the fast phase, so the spontaneous nystagmus is directed toward the healthy ear. The second element says nystagmus is greatest when gaze is directed toward the healthy ear, is attenuated at central gaze and may be absent when gaze is directed toward the impaired ear. The third element says that spontaneous nystagmus with central gaze is augmented when vision is denied. This became apparent with the implementation of electrographic testing. Alexander's law states that in individuals with nystagmus, the amplitude of the nystagmus increases when the eye moves in the direction of the fast phase (saccade). It is manifested during spontaneous nystagmus in a patient with a vestibular lesion. The nystagmus becomes more intense when the patient looks in the quick-phase than in the slow-phase direction. The law was named after Gustav Alexander who described it in 1912.Jacobson GP et al. Alexander's law revisited. J Am Acad Audiol 19:630-638 (2008) \n",

      " Volume 1 \n",
      " The story is set in 1839, eleven years after the events in Arthur Gordon Pym, one year after the publication of that book. The narrator is a wealthy American Jeorling, who has entertained himself with private studies of the wildlife on the Kerguelen Islands and is now looking for a passage back to the United States. Halbrane is one of the first ships to arrive at Kerguelen, and its captain Len Guy somewhat reluctantly agrees to have Jeorling as a passenger as far as Tristan da Cunha. Underway, they meet a stray iceberg with a dead body on it, which turns out to be a sailor from Jane. A note found with him indicates that he and several others including Jane's captain William Guy had survived the assassination attempt at Tsalal and are still alive. Guy, who had talked to Jeorling earlier about the subject of Pym, reveals himself to be the brother of William Guy. He decides to try to come to the rescue of Janes crew. After taking on provisions on Tristan da Cunha and the Falklands, they head South with Jeorling still on board. They also take aboard another mysterious sailor named Hunt who is eager to join the search for undisclosed reasons. Extraordinarily mild weather allows the Halbrane to make good progress, and they break the pack ice barrier, which surrounds an ice-free Antarctic ocean, early in summer. They find first Bennet's islet, where Jane had made a stop, and finally Tsalal. But the island is completely devastated, apparently by a recent massive earthquake, and deserted. They find the remains of Tsalal's natives, who apparently died long before the earthquake, and the collar of Pym's dog, Tiger, but no trace of Jane. \n",
      " Volume 2 \n",
      " At this point, Hunt is revealed to be Dirk Peters. On their travel south of Tsalal, he and Pym had become separated, and only Peters made it safely back to the States where he, not Pym, instigated the publication of their voyage. Pym's diary, in Peters' possession, had apparently been significantly embellished by Poe. Upon returning home, Peters took on a new identity, because he was too ashamed of having resorted to cannibalism on the wreck of Grampus. Guy and Peters decide to push further south, much to the chagrin of a part of the crew led by one seaman Hearne, who feels they should abandon the rescue attempt and head home before the onset of winter. thumb|right|The wreck of the Halbrane Not much later, in a freak accident, Halbrane is thrown upon an iceberg and subsequently lost. The crew makes it safely onto the iceberg, but with only one small boat left, it is doomed to drift on. The iceberg drifts even past the South Pole, before the whole party is cast ashore on a hitherto unknown land mass still within the pack ice barrier. Hearne and his fellows steal the last remaining boat, trying to make it to the open sea on their own, and making the situation even bleaker for those left behind who now face the prospect of wintering in the Antarctic. They are lucky, however, as shortly thereafter they see a small boat of aboriginal style drifting by. Peters is the first to react as he swims out toward the boat and secures it. But Peters finds more: In the boat, there are captain William Guy and the three surviving seamen of his crew, semiconscious and close to death by starvation. Peters brings them ashore, and the men from Halbrane nurse them back to life. William Guy then recounts their story. Shortly after the explosion of Jane (and presumably the departure of Pym's company), Tiger appeared again. Rabid, he bit and infected the natives who quickly fell victim to the new disease. Those who could fled to the neighboring islands, where they perished later in the course of the earthquake. Up to this point, William Guy and his men had lived fairly comfortably on Tsalal, which was now their own, but after the earthquake found their position untenable and made a desperate attempt in the boat to escape north. thumb|right|The Sphinx The combined crews of Halbrane and Jane decide to try to make it north in their newly acquired boat. They make good progress, until they notice the appearance of strong magnetic forces. They find the source of it, the Ice Sphinx: A huge mountain magnetically \"charged\" by the particle streams that get focused on the poles through Earth's magnetic field. Here, they find the remains of Hearne's team, which came to grief when the Ice Sphinx's immense magnetic forces attracted their iron tools and boat components to it and smashed them on its rocks. The boat of Joerling and the others only escaped destruction because, being built by the natives, it contained no iron parts. At the foot of the Sphinx, they also find the body of Pym, who came to death the same way. Peters dies from grief on the same spot. The others embark again in their boat, and finally reach the open ocean and are rescued. \n",

      "Alexander Pinkhosovich Podrabinek (; born 8 August 1953, Elektrostal) is a Soviet dissident, journalist and commentator. During the Soviet period he was a human rights activist, being exiled, then imprisoned in a corrective-labour colony, for publication of his book Punitive Medicine in Russian and in English.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents: Between prison and liberty, Moscow:AST, 2014. In 1987, while still forced to live outside Moscow in internal banishment, Podrabinek became the founder and editor-in-chief of the Express Chronicle weekly newspaper. In the 1990s he set up and ran the Prima information agency. Over the past ten years he has worked, variously, for the Novaya gazeta newspaper, the Yezhednevny Zhurnal website and the Russian Services of Radio France Internationale and Radio Liberty. \n",
      " Biography \n",
      " Alexander Podrabinek was born on 8 August 1953 in Elektrostal, a large provincial town in the Moscow Region to which his parents moved from Moscow in the early 1950s, to avoid the campaign against rootless cosmopolitans, i.e. Jews. He and his younger brother Kirill were brought up there by their Jewish father Pinkhos after his Russian wife died.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents: between Prison and Liberty, 2014, p. 13 (in Russian). At secondary school, aged ten, they joined the Young Pioneers, but later Alexander and Kirill did not apply to join the Komsomol, the only two non-members in their respective classes: the only explanation the school administration could find was that they were either Baptists or open enemies of the regime.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents: between Prison and Liberty, 2014, pp. 20-22 (in Russian). Alexander enrolled in the Department of Pharmacology of a medical institute in 1970 and worked as an assistant in a biology laboratory at Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry. From 1971 to 1974 Alexander studied at a college for medical auxiliary staff and received certification as a paramedic. He went on to work in the Moscow ambulance service. \n",
      "Dissent under Brezhnev and Gorbachev\n",
      " For political reasons, Podrabinek was denied entrance to medical school, and, at the age of 20, began working for the ambulance service instead. At an early age, Podrabinek became acquainted with dissident circles in Moscow and began to take part in their activities. (His medical father, himself the son of an \"Enemy of the People\" shot in 1937, did not discourage him.) After reading the notes that dissident poet Vladimir Gershuni's smuggled out of the Oryol Special Psychiatric hospital, Alexander became interested in the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR.\"Notes from Oryol Special Psychiatric Hospital by Vladimir Gershuni\", A Chronicle of Current Events, 19:2, 30 April 1971. Soon he was a contributing editor to the Chronicle of Current Events (1968-1982),A Chronicle of Current Events, 1968-1982. covering psychiatric issues. In January 1977, he also travelled to Siberia as a courier for the Social Fund, delivering money to the needy families of political prisoners, held in the camps or forced to live in exile.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents, 2014, pp. 86-93. \n",
      "Punitive Psychiatry\n",
      " On 5 January 1977, Podrabinek launched the Working Commission to Investigate the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes. The Commission at first had three other members (Vyacheslav Bakhmin, Irina Kaplun and Felix Serebrov), and its consultant psychiatrist was A.A. Voloshanovich. Around the Commission formed a circle of supporters \"without whom we could have done nothing,\" comments Podrabinek. \"The volume of work was too great.\".Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents, 2014, p. 226. They visited psychiatric hospitals, wrote appeals to hospital doctors, and published information on psychiatric abuse in their own information bulletins, and in other samizdat publications like the Chronicle of Current Events. In 1977, Podrabinek published Punitive Medicine [Карательная медицина], the Russian edition of his book on the systematic abuse of psychiatry for political purposes in the USSR. In December 1977, the KGB approached Podrabinek's father Pinkhos, and threatened to arrest and imprison both his sons (Kirill was suffering from TB) if the three of them did not agree to emigrate to Israel. (In an essay circulated in samizdat Kirill had criticized the treatment of conscripts in the Soviet army.) They discussed their predicament with other dissidents, notably Tatyana Velikanova, at the apartment of Andrei Sakharov. Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, urged the three to take the opportunity to leave the USSR. Alexander, supported by Velikanova, rejected the proposal and later held a press conference at the home of Andrei Sakharov, publicly asserting his refusal to given in to such blackmail.Alexander Podrabinek, Dissidents, 2014, p. 160 onwards. On 15 August 1978, Alexander Podrabinek was convicted of \"anti-Soviet slander\", sentenced to five years' banishment or internal exile, and was first transported to the Irkutsk Region, Siberia.\"The Trial of Alexander Podrabinek\", A Chronicle of Current Events, 50:7, November 1978. (His brother Kirill, meanwhile, was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon and was sent to a camp for ordinary criminals.\"The fate of the brothers Podrabinek\", Vesti iz SSSR, 1979, 1-8, 15 January 1979 (in Russian).) After the English edition of Punitive Medicine appeared, Podrabinek was again charged with political offences — he was by then exiled to Yakutia in the Soviet Far East — and at his trial in Ust-Nera on 6 January 1981, he was sentenced to three years in a local corrective-labour camp.\"The trial of Alexander Podrabinek\", Vesti iz SSSR, 15 January 1981 (in Russian). \n",
      "Return from the Far East\n",
      " In autumn 1986, prompted by Anatoly Marchenko's hunger strike in Chistopol Prison, Podrabinek, veteran dissident Larisa Bogoraz, and lawyer Sophia Kalistratova launched a campaign for the release of the Soviet Union's hundreds of political prisoners. They sent letters requesting a wide amnesty to the presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet and to Mikhail Gorbachev, the new leader of the Soviet Communist Party. There was no response. Then they began sending their two letters to prominent members of the artistic and technical intelligentsia: to writers, poets and artists; and to scientists and scholars. The result was disheartening. With notable exceptions, e.g. the world-famous animé artist Yury Norstein, very few would put their name to such a document.Alexander Podrabinek, \"Our campaign for an amnesty\", Znamya, April (No. 4), 2015 (in Russian). Retrieved 25 March 2018. In 1987, Podrabinek founded the weekly samizdat newspaper Express Chronicle, which appeared in Russian and English between 1987 and 2000. As the first uncensored media outlet in the USSR, with the Glasnost journal of Sergei Grigoryants, the Chronicle drew the interest of Western journalists in Moscow . The Chronicle circulated in a hundred major Soviet cities.Alexander Podrabinek, \"Our campaign for an amnesty\", Znamya, April (No. 4), 2015 (in Russian). In March 1989, Alexander participated in the founding of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia. \n",
      "Career as a journalist\n",
      " Podrabinek started working as a journalist during the Gorbachev years. From 1987 to 2000 he was editor-in-chief of the weekly human right magazine Express Chronicle («Экспресс Хроника»). In 2000, he became editor-in- chief of the Prima information agency, which specialized in human right issues. In 2004, Alexander Podrabinek became involved in the distribution of Blowing up Russia: Terror from within, the exposé written by Alexander Litvinenko and Yuri Felshtinsky. Unable to find a publisher in Russia, the authors printed an early draft in Latvia, intending to distribute it in Moscow. On 29 December 2003, however, units of the Russian Interior Ministry and the FSB seized 4,376 copies of the book purchased by Podrabinek's Prima information agency. The books had passed customs and were being driven by truck from Latvia to Moscow to be sold there. Podrabinek was summoned by the FSB for questioning on 28 January 2004, but he refused to answer their questions.Гостайну не выдал by Orhan Cemal, Novaya Gazeta, 29 January 2004.ФСБ: В книге \"ФСБ взрывает Россию\" разглашена гостайна, Grani.ru, 28 January 2004.ФСБ задержала тираж книги \"ФСБ взрывает Россию\", Grani.ru, 29 December 2003. In certain articles for Novaya gazeta, and comments on Radio Liberty, Podrabinek expressed concern that the use of psychiatry for political repression was reviving in Russia, in the enforced hospitalization of Larisa Arap, for instance. In 2009, Podrabinek was targeted by the nationalist youth movement Nashi after writing on the Yezhednevny Zhurnal website about a Moscow eating place opposite the \"Soviet\" Hotel which had renamed itself the \"Anti- Soviet\" Restaurant and put up a sign using its popular nickname. Local officials said the title was offensive to \"Soviet veterans and should be removed.\"Pamfilova Won't Apologize to Nashi, The St. Petersburg Times (October 9, 2009) (In early 2014 new legislation enabled the Communications Oversight Agency (or Rozkomnadzor) to block the Yezhednevny Zhurnal and Kasparov.ru websites.) Since 2014, Podrabinek has been host of the \"Déjà vu\" programme on Radio Liberty and his articles have been published by the Institute of Modern Russia. \n",
      "Activism\n",
      " Podrabinek has been interviewed, talking about his past as a Soviet dissident, in two documentaries: They Chose Freedom (2005) and Parallels, Events, People (2013). His contributions, past and present, were acknowledged in 2015 by the award of the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom. Podrabinek remains active and vocal as an opposition figure today. In March 2006 Podrabinek was briefly arrested in Minsk for involvement in peaceful protests against the re-election of the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko for the third term. In 2008 he supported the campaign to gain the admission of Vladimir Bukovsky to the presidential elections. On 3 June 2008, he became a founding signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism. In March 2010 Alexander Podrabinek signed the online anti-Putin manifesto of the Russian opposition \"Putin must go\". On 25 September 2013, he held a protest in support of imprisoned Nadezhda Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot band. On 4 May 2016, Podrabinek published An Open Letter to the Prosecutor of Crimea. In October 2017 Podrabinek drafted and launched a petition, calling on Russia's citizens not to support the hypocrisy of the Russian authorities who, on the one hand, unveiled the massive Wall of Sorrow a monument in Moscow to the victims of political repression, and, on the other, were responsible for the re-appearance of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in post-Soviet Russia. The petition was signed by many former Soviet dissidents from Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, the USA and France.\"Do not support their hypocrisy!\", 30 October 2017.

      "answer: title: Affective computing\n",
      "Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer science, psychology, and cognitive science. While some core ideas in the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into emotion, Cited by Tao and Tan. the more modern branch of computer science originated with Rosalind Picard's 1995 paper\"Affective Computing\" MIT Technical Report #321 (Abstract), 1995 on affective computing and her book Affective Computing published by MIT Press. One of the motivations for the research is the ability to give machines emotional intelligence, including to simulate empathy. The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behavior to them, giving an appropriate response to those emotions. \n",
      " Areas \n",
      " \n",
      "Detecting and recognizing emotional information\n",
      " Detecting emotional information usually begins with passive sensors that capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. For example, a video camera might capture facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, while a microphone might capture speech. Other sensors detect emotional cues by directly measuring physiological data, such as skin temperature and galvanic resistance. Recognizing emotional information requires the extraction of meaningful patterns from the gathered data. This is done using machine learning techniques that process different modalities, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, or facial expression detection. The goal of most of these techniques is to produce labels that would match the labels a human perceiver would give in the same situation: For example, if a person makes a facial expression furrowing their brow, then the computer vision system might be taught to label their face as appearing \"confused\" or as \"concentrating\" or \"slightly negative\" (as opposed to positive, which it might say if they were smiling in a happy-appearing way). These labels may or may not correspond to what the person is actually feeling. \n",
      "Emotion in machines\n",
      " Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. A more practical approach, based on current technological capabilities, is the simulation of emotions in conversational agents in order to enrich and facilitate interactivity between human and machine. Marvin Minsky, one of the pioneering computer scientists in artificial intelligence, relates emotions to the broader issues of machine intelligence stating in The Emotion Machine that emotion is \"not especially different from the processes that we call 'thinking.'\" \n",
      " Technologies \n",
      " In psychology, cognitive science, and in neuroscience, there have been two main approaches for describing how humans perceive and classify emotion: continuous or categorical. The continuous approach tends to use dimensions such as negative vs. positive, calm vs. aroused. The categorical approach tends to use discrete classes such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, disgust. Different kinds of machine learning regression and classification models can be used for having machines produce continuous or discrete labels. Sometimes models are also built that allow combinations across the categories, e.g. a happy-surprised face or a fearful- surprised face. The following sections consider many of the kinds of input data used for the task of emotion recognition. \n",
      "Emotional speech\n",
      " Various changes in the autonomic nervous system can indirectly alter a person's speech, and affective technologies can leverage this information to recognize emotion. For example, speech produced in a state of fear, anger, or joy becomes fast, loud, and precisely enunciated, with a higher and wider range in pitch, whereas emotions such as tiredness, boredom, or sadness tend to generate slow, low-pitched, and slurred speech. Some emotions have been found to be more easily computationally identified, such as anger or approval. Emotional speech processing technologies recognize the user's emotional state using computational analysis of speech features. Vocal parameters and prosodic features such as pitch variables and speech rate can be analyzed through pattern recognition techniques.Dellaert, F., Polizin, t., and Waibel, A., Recognizing Emotion in Speech\", In Proc. Of ICSLP 1996, Philadelphia, PA, pp.1970–1973, 1996Lee, C.M.; Narayanan, S.; Pieraccini, R., Recognition of Negative Emotion in the Human Speech Signals, Workshop on Auto. Speech Recognition and Understanding, Dec 2001 Speech analysis is an effective method of identifying affective state, having an average reported accuracy of 70 to 80% in research from 2003 and 2006. These systems tend to outperform average human accuracy (approximately 60%) but are less accurate than systems which employ other modalities for emotion detection, such as physiological states or facial expressions. However, since many speech characteristics are independent of semantics or culture, this technique is considered to be a promising route for further research. \n",
      "=Algorithms\n",
      "= The process of speech/text affect detection requires the creation of a reliable database, knowledge base, or vector space model, broad enough to fit every need for its application, as well as the selection of a successful classifier which will allow for quick and accurate emotion identification. , the most frequently used classifiers were linear discriminant classifiers (LDC), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Gaussian mixture model (GMM), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), decision tree algorithms and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Various studies showed that choosing the appropriate classifier can significantly enhance the overall performance of the system. The list below gives a brief description of each algorithm: * LDC – Classification happens based on the value obtained from the linear combination of the feature values, which are usually provided in the form of vector features. * k-NN – Classification happens by locating the object in the feature space, and comparing it with the k nearest neighbors (training examples). The majority vote decides on the classification. * GMM – is a probabilistic model used for representing the existence of subpopulations within the overall population. Each sub-population is described using the mixture distribution, which allows for classification of observations into the sub-populations.\"Gaussian Mixture Model\". Connexions – Sharing Knowledge and Building Communities. Retrieved 10 March 2011. * SVM – is a type of (usually binary) linear classifier which decides in which of the two (or more) possible classes, each input may fall into. * ANN – is a mathematical model, inspired by biological neural networks, that can better grasp possible non-linearities of the feature space. * Decision tree algorithms – work based on following a decision tree in which leaves represent the classification outcome, and branches represent the conjunction of subsequent features that lead to the classification. * HMMs – a statistical Markov model in which the states and state transitions are not directly available to observation. Instead, the series of outputs dependent on the states are visible. In the case of affect recognition, the outputs represent the sequence of speech feature vectors, which allow the deduction of states' sequences through which the model progressed. The states can consist of various intermediate steps in the expression of an emotion, and each of them has a probability distribution over the possible output vectors. The states' sequences allow us to predict the affective state which we are trying to classify, and this is one of the most commonly used techniques within the area of speech affect detection. It is proved that having enough acoustic evidence available the emotional state of a person can be classified by a set of majority voting classifiers. The proposed set of classifiers is based on three main classifiers: kNN, C4.5 and SVM-RBF Kernel. This set achieves better performance than each basic classifier taken separately. It is compared with two other sets of classifiers: one-against-all (OAA) multiclass SVM with Hybrid kernels and the set of classifiers which consists of the following two basic classifiers: C5.0 and Neural Network. The proposed variant achieves better performance than the other two sets of classifiers. \n",
      "=Databases\n",
      "= The vast majority of present systems are data-dependent. This creates one of the biggest challenges in detecting emotions based on speech, as it implicates choosing an appropriate database used to train the classifier. Most of the currently possessed data was obtained from actors and is thus a representation of archetypal emotions. Those so-called acted databases are usually based on the Basic Emotions theory (by Paul Ekman), which assumes the existence of six basic emotions (anger, fear, disgust, surprise, joy, sadness), the others simply being a mix of the former ones.Ekman, P. & Friesen, W. V (1969). The repertoire of nonverbal behavior: Categories, origins, usage, and coding. Semiotica, 1, 49–98. Nevertheless, these still offer high audio quality and balanced classes (although often too few), which contribute to high success rates in recognizing emotions. However, for real life application, naturalistic data is preferred. A naturalistic database can be produced by observation and analysis of subjects in their natural context. Ultimately, such database should allow the system to recognize emotions based on their context as well as work out the goals and outcomes of the interaction. The nature of this type of data allows for authentic real life implementation, due to the fact it describes states naturally occurring during the human–computer interaction (HCI). Despite the numerous advantages which naturalistic data has over acted data, it is difficult to obtain and usually has low emotional intensity. Moreover, data obtained in a natural context has lower signal quality, due to surroundings noise and distance of the subjects from the microphone. The first attempt to produce such database was the FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus for CEICES (Combining Efforts for Improving Automatic Classification of Emotional User States), which was developed based on a realistic context of children (age 10–13) playing with Sony's Aibo robot pet. Likewise, producing one standard database for all emotional research would provide a method of evaluating and comparing different affect recognition systems. \n",
      "=Speech descriptors\n",
      "= The complexity of the affect recognition process increases with the number of classes (affects) and speech descriptors used within the classifier. It is, therefore, crucial to select only the most relevant features in order to assure the ability of the model to successfully identify emotions, as well as increasing the performance, which is particularly significant to real-time detection. The range of possible choices is vast, with some studies mentioning the use of over 200 distinct features. It is crucial to identify those that are redundant and undesirable in order to optimize the system and increase the success rate of correct emotion detection. The most common speech characteristics are categorized into the following groups. # Frequency characteristics #* Accent shape – affected by the rate of change of the fundamental frequency. #* Average pitch – description of how high/low the speaker speaks relative to the normal speech. #* Contour slope – describes the tendency of the frequency change over time, it can be rising, falling or level. #* Final lowering – the amount by which the frequency falls at the end of an utterance. #* Pitch range – measures the spread between the maximum and minimum frequency of an utterance. # Time- related features: #* Speech rate – describes the rate of words or syllables uttered over a unit of time #* Stress frequency – measures the rate of occurrences of pitch accented utterances # Voice quality parameters and energy descriptors: #* Breathiness – measures the aspiration noise in speech #* Brilliance – describes the dominance of high Or low frequencies In the speech #* Loudness – measures the amplitude of the speech waveform, translates to the energy of an utterance #* Pause Discontinuity – describes the transitions between sound and silence #* Pitch Discontinuity – describes the transitions of the fundamental frequency. \n",
      "Facial affect detection\n",
      " The detection and processing of facial expression are achieved through various methods such as optical flow, hidden Markov models, neural network processing or active appearance models. More than one modalities can be combined or fused (multimodal recognition, e.g. facial expressions and speech prosody, facial expressions and hand gestures, or facial expressions with speech and text for multimodal data and metadata analysis) to provide a more robust estimation of the subject's emotional state. Affectiva is a company (co-founded by Rosalind Picard and Rana El Kaliouby) directly related to affective computing and aims at investigating solutions and software for facial affect detection. \n",
      "= Facial expression databases \n",
      "= Creation of an emotion database is a difficult and time-consuming task. However, database creation is an essential step in the creation of a system that will recognize human emotions. Most of the publicly available emotion databases include posed facial expressions only. In posed expression databases, the participants are asked to display different basic emotional expressions, while in spontaneous expression database, the expressions are natural. Spontaneous emotion elicitation requires significant effort in the selection of proper stimuli which can lead to a rich display of intended emotions. Secondly, the process involves tagging of emotions by trained individuals manually which makes the databases highly reliable. Since perception of expressions and their intensity is subjective in nature, the annotation by experts is essential for the purpose of validation. Researchers work with three types of databases, such as a database of peak expression images only, a database of image sequences portraying an emotion from neutral to its peak, and video clips with emotional annotations. Many facial expression databases have been created and made public for expression recognition purpose. Two of the widely used databases are CK+ and JAFFE. \n",
      "=Emotion classification\n",
      "= By doing cross-cultural research in Papua New Guinea, on the Fore Tribesmen, at the end of the 1960s, Paul Ekman proposed the idea that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal. Thus, he suggested that they are biological in origin and can, therefore, be safely and correctly categorized. He therefore officially put forth six basic emotions, in 1972: * Anger * Disgust * Fear * Happiness * Sadness * Surprise However, in the 1990s Ekman expanded his list of basic emotions, including a range of positive and negative emotions not all of which are encoded in facial muscles.. The newly included emotions are: # Amusement # Contempt # Contentment # Embarrassment # Excitement # Guilt # Pride in achievement # Relief # Satisfaction # Sensory pleasure # Shame \n",
      "=Facial Action Coding System\n",
      "= A system has been conceived by psychologists in order to formally categorize the physical expression of emotions on faces. The central concept of the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, as created by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978 based on earlier work by Carl-Herman Hjortsjö\"Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and the FACS Manual\" . A Human Face. Retrieved 21 March 2011. are action units (AU). They are, basically, a contraction or a relaxation of one or more muscles. Psychologists have proposed the following classification of six basic emotions, according to their action units (\"+\" here mean \"and\"): Emotion Action units Happiness 6+12 Sadness 1+4+15 Surprise 1+2+5B+26 Fear 1+2+4+5+20+26 Anger 4+5+7+23 Disgust 9+15+16 Contempt R12A+R14A \n",
      "=Challenges in facial detection\n",
      "= As with every computational practice, in affect detection by facial processing, some obstacles need to be surpassed, in order to fully unlock the hidden potential of the overall algorithm or method employed. In the early days of almost every kind of AI-based detection (speech recognition, face recognition, affect recognition), the accuracy of modeling and tracking has been an issue. As hardware evolves, as more data are collected and as new discoveries are made and new practices introduced, this lack of accuracy fades, leaving behind noise issues. However, methods for noise removal exist including neighborhood averaging, linear Gaussian smoothing, median filtering, or newer methods such as the Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm.Clever Algorithms. \"Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm – Swarm Algorithms – Clever Algorithms\" . Clever Algorithms. Retrieved 21 March 2011.\"Soft Computing\". Soft Computing. Retrieved 18 March 2011. Other challenges include * The fact that posed expressions, as used by most subjects of the various studies, are not natural, and therefore algorithms trained on these may not apply to natural expressions. * The lack of rotational movement freedom. Affect detection works very well with frontal use, but upon rotating the head more than 20 degrees, \"there've been problems\".Williams, Mark. \"Better Face-Recognition Software – Technology Review\". Technology Review: The Authority on the Future of Technology. Retrieved 21 March 2011. * Facial expressions do not always correspond to an underlying emotion that matches them (e.g. they can be posed or faked, or a person can feel emotions but maintain a \"poker face\"). * FACS did not include dynamics, while dynamics can help disambiguate (e.g. smiles of genuine happiness tend to have different dynamics than \"try to look happy\" smiles.) * The FACS combinations do not correspond in a 1:1 way with the emotions that the psychologists originally proposed (note that this lack of a 1:1 mapping also occurs in speech recognition with homophones and homonyms and many other sources of ambiguity, and may be mitigated by bringing in other channels of information). * Accuracy of recognition is improved by adding context; however, adding context and other modalities increases computational cost and complexity \n",
      "Body gesture\n",
      " Gestures could be efficiently used as a means of detecting a particular emotional state of the user, especially when used in conjunction with speech and face recognition. Depending on the specific action, gestures could be simple reflexive responses, like lifting your shoulders when you don't know the answer to a question, or they could be complex and meaningful as when communicating with sign language. Without making use of any object or surrounding environment, we can wave our hands, clap or beckon. On the other hand, when using objects, we can point at them, move, touch or handle these. A computer should be able to recognize these, analyze the context and respond in a meaningful way, in order to be efficiently used for Human–Computer Interaction. There are many proposed methodsJ. K. Aggarwal, Q. Cai, Human Motion Analysis: A Review, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Vol. 73, No. 3, 1999 to detect the body gesture. Some literature differentiates 2 different approaches in gesture recognition: a 3D model based and an appearance-based. The foremost method makes use of 3D information of key elements of the body parts in order to obtain several important parameters, like palm position or joint angles. On the other hand, appearance-based systems use images or videos to for direct interpretation. Hand gestures have been a common focus of body gesture detection methods. \n",
      "Physiological monitoring\n",
      " This could be used to detect a user's affective state by monitoring and analyzing their physiological signs. These signs range from changes in heart rate and skin conductance to minute contractions of the facial muscles and changes in facial blood flow. This area is gaining momentum and we are now seeing real products that implement the techniques. The four main physiological signs that are usually analyzed are blood volume pulse, galvanic skin response, facial electromyography, and facial color patterns. \n",
      "=Blood volume pulse\n",
      "= \n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      " A subject's blood volume pulse (BVP) can be measured by a process called photoplethysmography, which produces a graph indicating blood flow through the extremities.Picard, Rosalind (1998). Affective Computing. MIT. The peaks of the waves indicate a cardiac cycle where the heart has pumped blood to the extremities. If the subject experiences fear or is startled, their heart usually 'jumps' and beats quickly for some time, causing the amplitude of the cardiac cycle to increase. This can clearly be seen on a photoplethysmograph when the distance between the trough and the peak of the wave has decreased. As the subject calms down, and as the body's inner core expands, allowing more blood to flow back to the extremities, the cycle will return to normal. \n",
      "\n",
      "Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      " Infra-red light is shone on the skin by special sensor hardware, and the amount of light reflected is measured. The amount of reflected and transmitted light correlates to the BVP as light is absorbed by hemoglobin which is found richly in the bloodstream. \n",
      "\n",
      "Disadvantages\n",
      "\n",
      " It can be cumbersome to ensure that the sensor shining an infra-red light and monitoring the reflected light is always pointing at the same extremity, especially seeing as subjects often stretch and readjust their position while using a computer. There are other factors that can affect one's blood volume pulse. As it is a measure of blood flow through the extremities, if the subject feels hot, or particularly cold, then their body may allow more, or less, blood to flow to the extremities, all of this regardless of the subject's emotional state. thumb|left| The corrugator supercilii muscle and zygomaticus major muscle are the 2 main muscles used for measuring the electrical activity, in facial electromyography. \n",
      "=Facial electromyography\n",
      "= Facial electromyography is a technique used to measure the electrical activity of the facial muscles by amplifying the tiny electrical impulses that are generated by muscle fibers when they contract.Larsen JT, Norris CJ, Cacioppo JT, \"Effects of positive and negative affect on electromyographic activity over zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii\", (September 2003) The face expresses a great deal of emotion, however, there are two main facial muscle groups that are usually studied to detect emotion: The corrugator supercilii muscle, also known as the 'frowning' muscle, draws the brow down into a frown, and therefore is the best test for negative, unpleasant emotional response.↵The zygomaticus major muscle is responsible for pulling the corners of the mouth back when you smile, and therefore is the muscle used to test for a positive emotional response. 500px|thumb|Here we can see a plot of skin resistance measured using GSR and time whilst the subject played a video game. There are several peaks that are clear in the graph, which suggests that GSR is a good method of differentiating between an aroused and a non-aroused state. For example, at the start of the game where there is usually not much exciting game play, there is a high level of resistance recorded, which suggests a low level of conductivity and therefore less arousal. This is in clear contrast with the sudden trough where the player is killed as one is usually very stressed and tense as their character is killed in the game. \n",
      "=Galvanic skin response\n",
      "= Galvanic skin response (GSR) is an outdated term for a more general phenomenon known as [Electrodermal Activity] or EDA. EDA is a general phenomena whereby the skin's electrical properties change. The skin is innervated by the [sympathetic nervous system], so measuring its resistance or conductance provides a way to quantify small changes in the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system. As the sweat glands are activated, even before the skin feels sweaty, the level of the EDA can be captured (usually using conductance) and used to discern small changes in autonomic arousal. The more aroused a subject is, the greater the skin conductance tends to be. Skin conductance is often measured using two small silver-silver chloride electrodes placed somewhere on the skin and applying a small voltage between them. To maximize comfort and reduce irritation the electrodes can be placed on the wrist, legs, or feet, which leaves the hands fully free for daily activity. \n",

      "= \n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      " The surface of the human face is innervated with a large network of blood vessels. Blood flow variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the face. Whether or not facial emotions activate facial muscles, variations in blood flow, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other changes occur. Also, the facial color signal is independent from that provided by facial muscle movements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      " Approaches are based on facial color changes. Delaunay triangulation is used to create the triangular local areas. Some of these triangles which define the interior of the mouth and eyes (sclera and iris) are removed. Use the left triangular areas’ pixels to create feature vectors. It shows that converting the pixel color of the standard RGB color space to a color space such as oRGB color space or LMS channels perform better when dealing with faces.Hadas Shahar, Hagit Hel-Or, Micro Expression Classification using Facial Color and Deep Learning Methods, The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 0–0. So, map the above vector onto the better color space and decompose into red-green and yellow-blue channels. Then use deep learning methods to find equivalent emotions. \n",
      "Visual aesthetics\n",
      " Aesthetics, in the world of art and photography, refers to the principles of the nature and appreciation of beauty. Judging beauty and other aesthetic qualities is a highly subjective task. Computer scientists at Penn State treat the challenge of automatically inferring the aesthetic quality of pictures using their visual content as a machine learning problem, with a peer-rated on-line photo sharing website as a data source.Ritendra Datta, Dhiraj Joshi, Jia Li and James Z. Wang, Studying Aesthetics in Photographic Images Using a Computational Approach, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 3953, Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, Part III, pp. 288–301, Graz, Austria, May 2006. They extract certain visual features based on the intuition that they can discriminate between aesthetically pleasing and displeasing images. \n",
      "Potential applications\n",
      " \n",
      " Education \n",
      " Affection influences learners' learning state. Using affective computing technology, computers can judge the learners' affection and learning state by recognizing their facial expressions. In education, the teacher can use the analysis result to understand the student's learning and accepting ability, and then formulate reasonable teaching plans. At the same time, they can pay attention to students' inner feelings, which is helpful to students' psychological health. Especially in distance education, due to the separation of time and space, there is no emotional incentive between teachers and students for two-way communication. Without the atmosphere brought by traditional classroom learning, students are easily bored, and affect the learning effect. Applying affective computing in distance education system can effectively improve this situation. \n",
      " Healthcare \n",
      " Social robots, as well as a growing number of robots used in health care benefit from emotional awareness because they can better judge users' and patient's emotional states and alter their actions/programming appropriately. This is especially important in those countries with growing aging populations and/or a lack of younger workers to address their needs. Affective computing is also being applied to the development of communicative technologies for use by people with autism.Projects in Affective Computing The affective component of a text is also increasingly gaining attention, particularly its role in the so-called emotional or emotive Internet.Shanahan, James; Qu, Yan; Wiebe, Janyce (2006). Computing Attitude and Affect in Text: Theory and Applications. Dordrecht: Springer Science & Business Media. p. 94. \n",
      " Video games \n",
      " Affective video games can access their players' emotional states through biofeedback devices. A particularly simple form of biofeedback is available through gamepads that measure the pressure with which a button is pressed: this has been shown to correlate strongly with the players' level of arousal; at the other end of the scale are brain–computer interfaces. Affective games have been used in medical research to support the emotional development of autistic children. \n",
      " Other applications \n",
      " Other potential applications are centered around social monitoring. For example, a car can monitor the emotion of all occupants and engage in additional safety measures, such as alerting other vehicles if it detects the driver to be angry. Affective computing has potential applications in human–computer interaction, such as affective mirrors allowing the user to see how he or she performs; emotion monitoring agents sending a warning before one sends an angry email; or even music players selecting tracks based on mood. One idea put forth by the Romanian researcher Dr. Nicu Sebe in an interview is the analysis of a person's face while they are using a certain product (he mentioned ice cream as an example). Companies would then be able to use such analysis to infer whether their product will or will not be well received by the respective market. One could also use affective state recognition in order to judge the impact of a TV advertisement through a real- time video recording of that person and through the subsequent study of his or her facial expression. Averaging the results obtained on a large group of subjects, one can tell whether that commercial (or movie) has the desired effect and what the elements which interest the watcher most are. \n",
      "Cognitivist vs. interactional approaches\n",
      " Within the field of human–computer interaction, Rosalind Picard's cognitivist or \"information model\" concept of emotion has been criticized by and contrasted with the \"post-cognitivist\" or \"interactional\" pragmatist approach taken by Kirsten Boehner and others which views emotion as inherently social. Picard's focus is human–computer interaction, and her goal for affective computing is to \"give computers the ability to recognize, express, and in some cases, 'have' emotions\". In contrast, the interactional approach seeks to help \"people to understand and experience their own emotions\" and to improve computer-mediated interpersonal communication. It does not necessarily seek to map emotion into an objective mathematical model for machine interpretation, but rather let humans make sense of each other's emotional expressions in open-ended ways that might be ambiguous, subjective, and sensitive to context. Picard's critics describe her concept of emotion as \"objective, internal, private, and mechanistic\". They say it reduces emotion to a discrete psychological signal occurring inside the body that can be measured and which is an input to cognition, undercutting the complexity of emotional experience. The interactional approach asserts that though emotion has biophysical aspects, it is \"culturally grounded, dynamically experienced, and to some degree constructed in action and interaction\". Put another way, it considers \"emotion as a social and cultural product experienced through our interactions\". \n",

      "Adolf Grünbaum (; May 15, 1923 – November 15, 2018) was a German-American philosopher of science and a critic of psychoanalysis, as well as Karl Popper's philosophy of science. He was the first Andrew Mellon Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh from 1960 until his death, and also served as co-chairman of its Center for Philosophy of Science (from 1978), research professor of psychiatry (from 1979), and primary research professor in the department of history and philosophy of science (from 2006). His works include Philosophical Problems of Space and Time (1963), The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984), and Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis (1993). \n",
      "Life and career\n",
      " Being Jewish, Adolf Grünbaum's family left Nazi Germany in 1938 and emigrated to the United States. Grünbaum received a B.A. with twofold High Distinction in philosophy and in mathematics from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, in 1943. During the Second World War, Grünbaum was trained at Camp Ritchie, Maryland, and thus was one of the Ritchie Boys. He was stationed in Berlin and interrogated highly placed Nazis, returning to the United States in 1946. Grünbaum obtained both his M.S. in physics (1948) and his PhD in philosophy (1951) from Yale University. He was a chaired professor of philosophy at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (1956–1960), after rising through the ranks there, starting in 1950, becoming a full professor in 1955. In the fall of 1960, Grünbaum left Lehigh University to join the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh, where he became the first Andrew Mellon Professor of Philosophy. In that year, he also became the founding director of that University's Center for Philosophy of Science, serving as director until 1978. He and the colleagues he recruited then built world-class philosophy and history and philosophy of science departments at the university. Several of these colleagues had come from Yale University's philosophy department, starting in 1962. During this recruitment period the University of Pittsburgh appointed Nicholas Rescher, Wilfrid Sellars, Richard Gale, Nuel Belnap, Alan Ross Anderson, and Gerald Massey, among others. In 2003, Grünbaum resigned from the department of philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, while retaining his lifetime tenured Mellon Chair and all of his other affiliations at that university. Grünbaum served as president of both the American Philosophical Association (Eastern Division) and the Philosophy of Science Association (two terms). He was the director of the Center for Philosophy of Science from 1960 to 1978. He was the president of the Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science (IUHPS) in 2004–2005 and then automatically became president of the IUHPS from 2006 to 2007. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received the Senior U.S. Scientist Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Germany, 1985), the Fregene Prize for science from the Italian Parliament (1998) and the Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal for outstanding achievement from Yale University (1990). Also, in May 1995, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Konstanz in Germany and, in 2013, an honorary doctorate of philosophy from the University of Cologne in Germany. In 2013, he received the Großes Bundesverdienstkreuz from the Federal Republic of Germany. Grünbaum was Jewish. He died in November 2018 at the age of 95.University of Pittsburgh: Adolf Grünbaum death notice \n",
      "Philosophical work\n",
      " Grünbaum was the author of nearly 400 articles and book chapters as well as books on space-time and the critique of psychoanalysis. He is often viewed as part of the American brand of logical empiricism, associated especially with Hans Reichenbach. Grünbaum did not embrace the prevailing — especially among physical scientists — Popperian philosophy of science, leading to some notoriety in the 1960s after he was ridiculed in print by the physicist Richard Feynman.James Gleick, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman (New York: Pantheon Books, 1992, pp. 123-4) A much- quoted exchange followed Grünbaum's neo-Leibnizian suggestion that the flow of time might be an illusion only in conscious entities, in which Feynman asked whether dogs, then cockroaches, were sufficiently conscious entities.Thomas Gold (ed.), The Nature of Time (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1967). Reportedly as a mark of further disdain,Hermann Bondi, \"Thomas Gold. 22 May 1920 — 22 June 2004,\" Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, 2006 52, 117-35 Feynman refused to let his name be printed, becoming instead the easily recognizable \"Mr. X\". Some 40 years later, writer Jim Holt would characterize Grünbaum as, in the 1950s, \"the foremost thinker about the subtleties of space and time,\" and as, by the 2000s, \"arguably the greatest living philosopher of science.\" Holt portrays a rationalist Grünbaum who rejects any hint of mysteriousness in the cosmos (a \"great rejector\").Jim Holt, Why Does the World Exist?

Among stable nuclei and naturally occurring nuclei, this ratio generally increases with increasing atomic number. This is because electrical repulsive forces between protons scale with distance differently than strong nuclear force attractions. In particular, most pairs of protons in large nuclei are not far enough apart, such that electrical repulsion dominates over the strong nuclear force, and thus proton density in stable larger nuclei must be lower than in stable smaller nuclei where more pairs of protons have appreciable short-range nuclear force attractions. For each element with atomic number Z small enough to occupy only the first three nuclear shells, that is up to that of calcium (Z = 20), there exists a stable isotope with N/Z ratio of one, with the exception of beryllium (N/Z = 1.25) and every element with odd atom\n",

      "The Apollo 12 Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE) was placed on the lunar surface by the Apollo 12 mission as part of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP). The PSE was designed to detect vibrations and tilting of the lunar surface and measure changes in gravity at the instrument location. The vibrations are due to internal seismic sources (moonquakes) and external (meteoroids and impacts from the spent S-IVB and LM ascent stages). The primary objective of the experiment was to use these data to determine the internal structure, physical state, and tectonic activity of the Moon. The secondary objectives were to determine the number and mass of meteoroids that strike the Moon and record tidal deformations of the lunar surface. \n",
      "Specification\n",
      " The PSE unit was constructed principally of beryllium and had a mass of 11.5 kg, including the electronics module and thermal insulation. It was housed in a drum-shaped enclosure 23 cm in diameter and 29 cm in height. The enclosure was rounded on the bottom and rested on a leveling stool. The PSE consisted of two main subsystems, a sensor unit and an electronics module. The sensor unit contained three matched long-period (LP) seismometers aligned orthogonally in a triaxial set to measure one vertical and two horizontal components of surface motion. The horizontal component seismometers were very sensitive to tilt and were leveled to high accuracy by means of a two-axis motor-driven gimbal operated by ground command. A third motor adjusted the vertical component seismometer in the vertical direction. A fourth, short-period (SP) seismometer with a resonant period of 1 second measured vertical motion at a peak sensitivity of 8 Hz and a response range from 0.05 to 20 Hz. A thermal shroud and 2.5-W heater for thermal control comprised the rest of the experiment package. The thermal shroud was aluminized mylar which covered the instrument and the ground surrounding the base out to about 75 cm radially. A gnomon and level sensor were mounted on the top center of the shroud. Total power drain varied from 4.3 to 7.4 W. The seismometers consisted of an inertial mass on a sensor boom suspended by springs and hinges, a capacitor plate and a damping magnet. The LP seismometers could function in a flat-response mode and in a peaked response mode. In the flat response mode, the LP seismometers had a natural period of 15 s. In the peaked-response mode, they acted as underdamped pendulums with a natural period of 2.2 s. Sensitivity to ground motion peaked sharply at 0.45 Hz in peaked response mode with a useful frequency range of 0.004 to 2 Hz. Maximum sensitivity was enhanced by a factor of 5.6 in the peaked response mode, but sensitivity to low-frequency signals was reduced. All seismometers could detect ground motions as small as 0.3 nm. At tidal frequencies, gravitational acceleration was measured by monitoring the feedback current used to center the seismometer mass. The sensitivity of the instruments was 0.008 mgal. The lunar surface impacts of the spent S-IVB and LM ascent stages were used as external calibration sources for the seismometers. The known mass and velocity of these stages at surface impact and the lunar impact point coordinates enabled the computation of energy generated at impact and the point of energy application. (The calibration characteristics were determined by measuring seismometer response to these energy sources.) \n",
      "Deployment\n",
      " The seismometers were deployed on 19 November 1969 and operated at reduced gain while the astronauts were on the lunar surface and turned to maximum sensitivity for most of the time after that. The ALSEP central station was located at . The passive seismic experiment was deployed 3 meters east of the central station. The SP seismometer displayed reduced sensitivity at low signal levels following deployment. Seismic disturbances were noted throughout the lunar day, but particularly near sunrise and sunset, these were believed to be due to expansion and contraction of the mylar shroud and/or the cable to the central station. Once the astronauts had returned to the CSM, the LM ascent stage was released and collided with the Moon. The LM hit the lunar surface at 6,048 km/h and created an estimated 9 meter wide crater. The shock waves from the impact were a surprise to the scientists, with the Moon vibrating for over 55 minutes. The seismometers also recorded signals that were totally unlike any received before, starting with small waves that gained in size to a peak which persisted for a long time. It was reported that even after an hour the smallest reverberations had not yet stopped. The Apollo 13 S-IVB with its Instrument Unit was guided to crash onto the lunar surface on April 14, 1970, providing a signal for the PSE. Operation was normal with a few minor incidents over the years until the PSE was commanded to standby on 30 September 1977 as part of the ALSEP station shutdown. \n",

      "original_text: What is the anomeric effect?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Anomeric effect\n",
      "In organic chemistry, the anomeric effect or Edward-Lemieux effect is a stereoelectronic effect that describes the tendency of heteroatomic substituents adjacent to a heteroatom within a cyclohexane ring to prefer the axial orientation instead of the less hindered equatorial orientation that would be expected from steric considerations. This effect was originally observed in pyranose rings by J. T. Edward in 1955 when studying carbohydrate chemistry. The term anomeric effect was introduced in 1958. The name comes from the term used to designate the lowest-numbered ring carbon of a pyranose, the anomeric carbon. Isomers that differ only in the configuration at the anomeric carbon are called anomers. The anomers of D-glucopyranose are diastereomers, with the beta anomer having an OH group pointing up equatorially, and the alpha anomer having that OH group pointing down axially. The anomeric effect can also be generalized to any cyclohexyl or linear system with the general formula C-Y-C-X, where Y is a heteroatom with one or more lone pairs, and X is an electronegative atom or group. The magnitude of the anomeric effect is estimated at about 1–2 kcal/mol in the case of sugars, but is different for every molecule. center|377px In the above case, the methoxy group on the cyclohexane ring (top) prefers the equatorial position. However, in the tetrahydropyran ring (bottom), the methoxy group prefers the axial position. This is because in the cyclohexane ring, Y= carbon, which is not a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect is not observed and sterics dominates the observed substituent position. In the tetrahydropyran ring, Y= oxygen, which is a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect contributes and stabilizes the observed substituent position. In both cases, X= OMe. The anomeric effect is most often observed when Y= oxygen, but can also be seen with other lone pair bearing heteroatoms in the ring, such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The exact method by which the anomeric effect causes stabilization is a point of controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain it. \n",
      "Physical explanation and controversy\n",
      " The physical reason for the anomeric effect is not completely understood. Several, in part conflicting, explanations have been offered and the topic is still not settled. \n",
      "Hyperconjugation\n",
      " \n",
      "=Cyclic molecules\n",
      "= A widely accepted explanation is that there is a stabilizing interaction (hyperconjugation) between the unshared electron pair on the endocyclic heteroatom (within the sugar ring) and the σ* orbital of the axial (exocyclic) C–X bond. This causes the molecule to align the donating lone pair of electrons antiperiplanar (180°) to the exocyclic C-X σ bond, lowering the overall energy of the system and causing more stability. center|377px Some authors also question the validity of this hyperconjugation model based on results from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. While most studies on the anomeric effects have been theoretical in nature, the n–σ* (hyperconjugation) hypothesis has also been extensively criticized on the basis that the electron density redistribution in acetals proposed by this hypothesis is not congruent with the known experimental chemistry of acetals and, in particular, the chemistry of monosaccharides. \n",
      "=Acyclic molecules\n",
      "= Hyperconjugation is also found in acyclic molecules containing heteroatoms, another form of the anomeric effect. If a molecule has an atom with a lone pair of electrons and the adjacent atom is able to accept electrons into the σ* orbital, hyperconjugation occurs, stabilizing the molecule. This forms a \"no bond\" resonance form. For this orbital overlap to occur, the trans, trans conformation is preferred for most heteroatoms, however for the stabilization to occur in dimethoxymethane, the gauche, gauche conformation is about 3–5 kcal/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the trans,trans conformation—this is about two times as big as the effect in sugars because there are two rotatable bonds (hence it is trans around both bonds or gauche around both) that are affected. center|377px \n",
      "Dipole minimization\n",
      " Another accepted explanation for the anomeric effect is the equatorial configuration has the dipoles involving both heteroatoms partially aligned, and therefore repelling each other. By contrast the axial configuration has these dipoles roughly opposing, thus representing a more stable and lower energy state. center|434px Both the hyperconjugation and the dipole minimization contribute to the preferred (Z)-conformation of esters over the (E)-conformation. In the (Z) conformation the lone pair of electrons in the alpha oxygen can donate into the neighboring σ* C-O orbital. In addition, the dipole is minimized in the (Z)-conformation and maximized in the (E)-conformation. center|377px \n",
      "n-n repulsions and C-H hydrogen bonding\n",
      " If the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygens at the anomeric center of 2-methoxypyran are shown, then a brief examination of the conformations of the anomers reveal that the β-anomer always has at least one pair of eclipsing (coplanar 1,3-interacting) lone pairs, this n-n repulsion is a high energy situation. On the other hand, the α-anomer has conformations in which there are no n-n repulsions, and that is true in the exo-anomeric conformation. The energetically unfavourable n-n repulsion present in the β-anomer, coupled with the energetically favourable hydrogen bond between the axial H-5 and a lone pair of electrons on the axial α-anomeric substituent (C-H/n hydrogen bond), have been suggested [references 7 and 8] to account for most of the energetic difference between the anomers, the anomeric effect. The molecular mechanics program StruMM3D, which is not specially parameterized for the anomeric effect, estimates that the dipolar contributions to the anomeric effect (primarily the n-n repulsion, and C-H hydrogen bonding discussed above) are about 1.5 kcal/mol. \n",
      "Influences\n",
      " While the anomeric effect is a general explanation for this type of stabilization for a molecule, the type and amount of stabilization can be affected by the substituents being examined as well as the solvent being studied. \n",
      "Substituent effect\n",
      " In a closed system, there is a difference observed in the anomeric effect for different substituents on a cyclohexane or tetrahydropyran ring (Y=Oxygen). When X=OH, the generic anomeric effect can be seen, as previously explained. When X=CN, the same results are seen, where the equatorial position is preferred on the cyclohexane ring, but the axial position is preferred on the tetrahydropyran ring. This is consistent with the anomeric effect stabilization. When X=F, the anomeric effect is in fact observed for both rings. However, when X=NH2, no anomeric effect stabilization is observed and both systems prefer the equatorial position. This is attributed to both sterics and an effect called the reverse anomeric effect (see below). \n",
      "Solvent effect\n",
      " One common criticism of the hyperconjugation theory is that it fails to explain why the anomeric effect is not observed when substituted tetrahydropyran molecules are placed in polar solvents, and the equatorial position is once again preferred. It has been shown, however, that hyperconjugation does depend on the solvent in the system. Each of the substituted systems described above were tested in the gas phase (i.e. with no solvent) and in aqueous solution (i.e. polar solvent). When X=F, the anomeric effect was observed in both media, and the axial position was always preferred. This is attributed to hyperconjugation. When X=OH or CN, the anomeric effect was seen in the gas phase, when the axial position was preferred. However, in aqueous solutions, both substituents preferred the equatorial position. This is attributed to the fact that there are more electrostatic repulsions with the axial positioned substituent and the polar solvent, causing the equatorial position to be preferred. When X=NH2, again, no anomeric effect was observed and the equatorial position was always preferred. \n",
      "Overcoming the anomeric effect\n",
      " While the anomeric effect can cause stabilization of molecules, it does have a magnitude to its stabilization, and this value can be overcome by other, more destabilizing effects in some cases. center|377px In the example of spiroketals, the orientation on the upper left shows stabilization by the hyperconjugative anomeric effect twice, thus greatly stabilizing the orientation of the molecule. The orientation on the upper right only shows this hyperconjugative anomeric stabilization once, causing it to be the lesser preferred structure. However, when substituent are added onto the spiroketal backbone, the more preferred structure can be changed. When a large substituent is added to the spiroketal backbone, as seen in the lower left, the strain from having this large substituent, R, in the axial position is greatly destabilizing to the molecule. In the molecule on the lower right, R is now in the equatorial position, which no longer causes destabilization on the molecule. Therefore, without substituents, the upper equilibrium reaction is favored on the left hand side, while the lower equilibrium is favored on the right hand side, simply from the addition of a large, destabilizing substituent. \n",
      "Exo anomeric effect\n",
      " An extension of the anomeric effect, the exo anomeric effect is the preference of substituents coming off a ring to adopt the gauche conformation, while sterics would suggest an antiperiplanar conformation would be preferred. center|433px An example of this is 2-methoxytetrahydropyran. As the anomeric effect predicts, the methoxy substituent shows an increased preference for the axial conformation. However, there is actually more than one possible axial conformation due to rotation about the C-O bond between the methoxy substituent and the ring. When one applies the principles of the reverse anomeric effect, it can be predicted that the gauche conformer is preferred, suggesting the top left conformation is best in the figure above. This prediction is supported by experimental evidence. Furthermore, this preference for the gauche position is still seen in the equatorial conformation. \n",
      "Reverse anomeric effect\n",
      " This term refers to the apparent preference of positively charged nitrogen substituents for the equatorial conformation beyond what normal steric interactions would predict in rings containing an electronegative atom, such as oxygen. Substituents containing carbons with partial positive charges are not seen to exhibit the same effect. Theoretical explanations for the reverse anomeric effect include an electrostatic explanation and the delocalization of the sp3 electrons of the anomeric carbon and oxygen lone pair. There is some debate as to whether or not this is a real phenomenon. The nitrogen containing substituents it has been reported with are quite bulky, making it hard to separate the normal effects of steric bulk and the reverse anomeric effect, if it does exist. For example, in the molecule shown below, the pyridinium substituent strongly prefers the equatorial position, as steric factors would predict, but actually shows a stronger preference for this conformation than predicted, suggesting the reverse anomeric effect is contributing. center|433px \n",
      "Metallo-anomeric effect\n",
      " Late transition metals from groups 10, 11, and 12 when placed at the anomeric carbon show strong axial preferences. This phenomenon termed as the metallo- anomeric effect originates from stabilizing hyperconjugative interactions between oxygen or other heteroatoms with lone pairs and C-M anti-bonding orbitals that act as good acceptors. The generalized metallo-anomeric effect refers to thermodynamic stabilization of synclinal conformers of compounds with the general formula M-CH2-OR. Axial/equatorial preferences can be influenced by ligands attached to the metal and electronic configuration. In general terms, moving from a lighter to a heavier element in the group, the magnitude of the metallo-anomeric effect increases. Furthermore, higher oxidation states favor axial/synclinal conformers. \n",
      "Synthetic applications\n",
      " The anomeric effect is taken into consideration synthetically. Due to its discovery in sugars, sugar and carbohydrate chemistry is one of the more common synthetic uses of the anomeric effect. For instance, the Koenigs-Knorr glycosidation installs an α-OR or β-OR group in high diastereoselectivity which is effected by the anomeric effect. Sophorolipid lactone, (+)-Lepicidin A, and (−)-Lithospermoside are a few of the products synthesized via the Koenigs-Knorr Glycosidation overcoming the anomeric effect. center|700px \n",

Her father's former superior, retired Rear Admiral Kusumi is confronted by a peculiar reporter, who claims contrarily that Captain Jinguji is alive and at work on a new submarine project. The threads meet when a mysterious taxi driver attempts to abduct Makoto and the Admiral, claiming to be an agent of the drowned Mu Empire. Foiled by the pursuing photographers, he flees into the ocean. During another visit to the detective, a package inscribed \"MU\" arrives for the Admiral. Contained within is a film depicting the thriving undersea continent (with its own geothermal \"sun\") and demanding that the surface world capitulate, and prevent Jinguji from completing his Atragon submarine, named Gotengo. The UN realizes that the Atragon may be the world's only defense and requests that Admiral Kosumi appeal to Jinguji. Concurrently, Makoto's stalker is arrested and discovered to be a naval officer under Jinguji. He agrees to lead the party to Jinguji's base but refuses to disclose its location. After several days of travel, the party find themselves on a tropical island inhabited only by Jinguji's forces and enclosing a vast underground dock. Eventually Captain Jinguji greets the visitors, though he is cold toward his daughter and infuriated by Kusumi's appeal. He built Gotengo, he explains, as a means to restore the Empire of Japan after its defeat in World War II, and insists that it be used for no other purpose. Makoto runs off in anger, later to be consoled by Susumu. Gotengo's test run is a success, the heavily armored submarine even elevating out of the water and flying about the island. When the Captain approaches Makoto that evening they exchange harsh words; again Susumu reproaches the Captain for his selfish refusal to come to the world's aid. After Makoto and Susumu are kidnapped by the reporter, and the base crippled by a bomb, Jinguji consents to Kusumi's request and prepares Gotengo for war against Mu. The Mu Empire executes a devastating attack on Tokyo and threatens to sacrifice its prisoners to the monstrous deity Manda if the Atragon appears. The submarine appears, pursuing a Mu submarine to the Empire's entrance in the ocean depths. Meanwhile, Susumu and the other prisoners escape their cell and kidnap the Empress of Mu. They are impeded by Manda, but soon rescued by Gotengo, which then engages the serpent and freezes it using the \"Absolute Zero Cannon\". Jinguji offers to hear peace terms, but the proud Empress refuses. The Captain then advances Gotengo into the heart of the Empire power room and freezes its geothermal machinery before successfully escaping to the surface. This results in a cataclysmic explosion visible even to those on deck of the surfaced submarine. Her empire dying, the Mu Empress abandons the Atragon and, Jinguji and company looking on, swims into the conflagration. \n",

      " Atragon is loosely based on The Undersea Warship: A Fantastic Tale of Island Adventure (1899) by Shunrō Oshikawa and The Undersea Kingdom (1954-1955) by Shigeru Komatsuzaki. Komatsuzaki also served as an uncredited designer for the film, as he had with The Mysterians and Battle in Outer Space. Shinichi Sekizawa submitted his first draft on August 10, 1963, following revisions and storyboards by Komatsuzaki. Sekizawa thought up the character of Jinguji after reading about the Brazilian-Japanese groups Machigumi and Kachigumi, one of which felt that Japan should have won World War II. He saw this as pointless fanaticism and wanted to embody this in the admiral whose nationalism blinds him. Instead of a dragon, Manda was envisioned as a giant rattlesnake. There is some debate as to whether Manda was always in the script (a snake monster doesn’t appear in the Undersea Kingdom) or whether the beast was added at Tomoyuki Tanaka’s insistence like he did with Maguma in Gorath (1962). Manda’s design was changed to resemble a Chinese dragon due to 1964 being the Year of the Dragon, and this was Toho’s New Year’s blockbuster. Many of the film’s most memorable elements weren’t added until the final draft, which was finished by September 1963. This includes the Mu attack launched from Mt. Fuji, the earthquake assault on Marunochi in Tokyo, and the Gotengo’s zero cannon. Sekizawa also hoped that Captain Jinguji would be played by Toshiro Mifune, though he know his hopes were in vain as Mifune was too expensive and tended to decline offers for giant monster films. Sekizawa originally wrote a scene in a late draft of the script where Jinguji learned of his daughter's kidnapping and was prepared to sacrifice her in order to save the world, which triggered an argument between Jinguji and Kosumi. This was cut by director Ishiro Honda because he saw the story as a parable of global problems rather than personal problems. The film was originally scheduled to show the Mu Empire also attacking New York City, but there wasn’t enough time due to the rushed shooting schedule. Another elaborate deleted scene is expressed in the film's storyboards and occurs as the characters arrive on Jinguji’s island. As they drive through the vast wasteland In the jeep, they are consumed by a black dust cloud. The jeep almost drives into a huge pit, with Makota saved by Susumu. \n",
      "Filming\n",
      " Shinichi Sekizawa originally wrote the character of Jinguji for Toshiro Mifune. However, no one approached the actor prior and by the time casting was underway Mifune was already tied up in rehearsals for what would be a 18 month shoot for Red Beard (1965). Ishiro Honda had no idea whom to cast as the Empress of Mu but met Tetsuko Kobayashi by chance, who was working on a TV show in Toho's lot. Honda found her to be \"hard working and very energetic.\" Kobayashi also applied the Empress' makeup herself. Over 70,000,000 yen was spent on the construction of sets and props for the film. By Toho standards, this was a large sum although less than recent productions such as Gorath (1962). The film's production schedule was shorter than usual, with production beginning September 5, 1963, targeted for a December release of that same year. This resulted in effects director Eiji Tsuburaya scaling back some effects. Honda originally wanted to show towns and residual areas for the Mu Empire but did not have enough money in the budget. The film became the 13th highest grossing domestic film of the year, grossing 175 million yen. \n",
      "Special effects\n",
      " Five models of the Gotengo were built for the film with steel hulls for supporting their internal mechanisms. All at various scales, the largest was 4.5 meters (15 feet long), manufactured by an actual ship- building company for the price of 1,500,000 yen. This version was fully operational with wings, fins, gun turrets, the bridge, and the drill all movable by remote radio control devices built into the hull. This model was large enough for a technician to lie inside the hull and manually operate some of the ships movable parts. Other models of the Gotengo were built to lengths of 3 meters (1/50) scale, 2 meters (1/75) scale, 1-meter (1/150) scale, and 30 cm (1/500) scale. Altogether, two models of each of these scales were built except for the 30 cm version, of which five were built. The 30 cm model was used mainly in water tank shots to depict the Gotengo cruising on the surface of the sea. A small mechanical arm was attached to the ship beneath the water line, providing the ship mobility from outside the camera’s vantage point. The film’s highlight is the trial run of the Gotengo. Using an indoor water tank with a miniature shore line placed in front of a huge curved backdrop painting, the scene was shot in three different cuts, each of which used a different scale miniature sub. The initial scene showing the Gotengo surfacing was done by Eiji Tsuburaya without any composition. The five-meter model was used to express the illusion of mass as the ship rises. From the water tank. The model was attached to an underwater crane that forced the ship through to the surface of the pool. High-speed photography was employed with the camera cranking at 10 times normal speed. As the ship began to fly, a two-meter model, suspended by wires, was also filmed at high speed. Air jets located at the bottom of the model created the illusion of upward propulsion. The final cut of the scene utilized a one-meter model to depict the Gotengo slowly flying forward in a long shot. The scene where the American submarine Red Satan is crushed by water pressure was done by pumping air out of the model. The largest set for the film was inside Toho’s Stage No. 11, then the largest on the back-lot. An elaborate backdrop measuring 30 feet high and 120 feet long was made for long shots of the Empress and her court overseeing the Mu ritual. The royal contingent, consisting mostly of the wives of American servicemen, was placed on a small platform with the pillars, balcony, and antechambers all painted in perspective on the backdrop. The chamber was filled with 600 male and female dancers were choreographed by Ishiro Honda to Akira Ifukube’s Mu ritual music. The destruction of the Tokyo business district required that the Ginza and Marunouchi areas be reproduced in miniature at 1/20 scale. The buildings were made of plaster, and only a handful were made with internal steel structures, so that the buildings would partially survive the destruction. When the model was completed, stagehands crawled under the platform and partially cut though the main supports. Ropes were then tied to each support beam, and all the ropes were attached to the bumper of a truck. Tsuburaya’s vision of the scene was that the underground collapse would slowly ripple through the city, destroying it in a rolling wave. The destruction of the Ginza and Marunouchi districts did not go as planned. When time came for shooting, the technician who was driving the truck panicked and drove off too quickly, causing the entire model city to collapse at the same time. The staff all gasped, thinking the shot was ruined and that Tsuburaya would surly order the set rebuilt for another take. Tsuburaya stood silently for a while contemplating the situation, and finally he announced that he would take care of the matter in editing room. The attack by the Mu submarine on Tokyo Bay was done in the huge 100-centimeter water tank located outdoors on the Toho backlot. Ten miniature tankers were constructed, each to a different scale, the maximum scale being 1/20 and the smallest 1/100. These ships were distributed in the water tank to create a forced perspective, adding greater depth to the scene than the confines of the tank would normally allow. Since the scene was shot with high-speed photography for more realism, a great amount of light was required for filming. Natural sunlight was sufficiently bright for filming only between 3:00PM and 4:00PM, so preparations were made from sunrise to ready the set for a tight afternoon shooting schedule. Six automatic remote-control cameras shot the scene simultaneously as six miniature ships exploded in sequence. Conventional animation was used to add the Mu subs ray to live action. The aqualungs used by the Mu agents cost 70,000 yen each, with an additional charge of 100,000 yen to Toho for custom design of the suit. Altogether, 30 such aqualungs were built, and each was fully functional for underwater use. The underwater sequences were achieved through camera filters and smoke machines. The immense wall of smoke and flames which erupted from the explosion of the Mu power chamber was created using a small water tank against which a camera was secured upside down beneath the water line. A sky backdrop was placed behind the water, and colored paints were poured into the water, creating billowing, smoke-like clouds. The mu submarines which were destroyed by the Gotengo’s freeze cannon were 2 cm models built to float upside down in the water tank. The ice flow in which the subs were trapped prior to their demise consisted of paraffin. The scene where Shingugi’s strike team uses freeze ray guns on attacking Mu soldiers was done using matte paintings. The underwater sequences were achieved through camera filters and smoke machines. \n",
      "Release\n",
      " Atragon was released in Japan on December 22, 1963. It became the 13th highest grossing domestic film of the year, grossing ¥175 million. Atragon became a popular feature on TV and at film festivals. In fact, it was so popular that it was re-released in 1968 as the support feature for Honda's Destroy All Monsters. It was also the 1964 Japanese entry at the Trieste Science Fiction Film Festival.Parish, James Robert and Michael R. Pitts. The Great Science Fiction Pictures. American International Pictures afforded the film a successful US theatrical release in 1965, with minimal changes and quality dubbing by Titra Studios, as a double feature with The Time Travelers. The new name Atragon, derived from Toho's international title Atoragon, is presumably a contraction of \"atomic dragon\", a colorful moniker for the titular juggernaut; however, AIP's dubbed dialogue refers to the Goten-go by the name \"Atragon\". This shortening from four to three syllables was the choice of AIP, since several European markets released the film as Atoragon (Italy) and Ataragon (France). While Atragon became Toho's first tokusatsu eiga (visual effects film) released on home video in 1982, and though the film is exceptionally popular among western tokusatsu fans, Atragon was not released on home video in the United States until Media-Blasters' DVD in 2005 (although the film was in constant television syndication in the US until the early 1980s). Media Blasters had intended to use the original Titra Studios dubbing, but Toho forced the company to use its international version. This alternate dubbed version syncs up precisely with the Japanese video, but fans generally consider these international dubs to be inferior. \n",

In the book a group of Swedish Communists blow up a German train passing through Sweden, killing several hundred German soldiers and Eva Braun who was on board. Adolf Hitler is infuriated and invades Sweden, which surrenders on 12 May 1941. The novel uses many real-life characters.Sydsvenskan: Två nyanser av rödbrunt Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson is captured by the Germans, but others manage to escape and form an exile government in London. King Gustav V is also captured but abdicates, making prince Gustaf VI Adolf, who was already safely in London, the new king. Raoul Wallenberg smuggles Jews out of Sweden. More controversially, the book also mentions those who collaborate with the Germans. Author Per Olof Sundman and IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad lead local SS groups. Fredrik Böök, Sven Hedin, Åke Ohlmarks and many others support the new rulers. Sven Olov Lindholm becomes a Quisling-like leader of occupied Sweden. Due to the invasion of Sweden, Operation Barbarossa gets delayed by three weeks, giving Stalin time to organize a better defense, bringing the German downfall sooner. The Allied invasion of Normandy occurs in the spring of 1944 rather than in June. Hitler commits suicide in December 1944, and World War II ends in Europe on 28 December. By then, Sweden has been liberated from the north down as far as Östersund by the British, the Soviets and a British- trained Swedish exile army.

      " FLEET is pursuing three broad research themes to develop devices in which electrical current can flow without resistance: * Topological insulators: a relatively new class of materials and recognised by the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics, topological insulators conduct electricity only along their edges, and strictly in one direction. This one-way path conducts electricity without loss of energy due to resistance. Approaches being used within FLEET to study topological materials include magnetic topological insulators and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), topological Dirac semimetals (including oxide ‘antiperovskites’) and artificial topological systems (artificial graphene and 2D topological insulators). * Exciton superfluids: a quantum state known to achieve electrical current flow with minimal wasted dissipation of energy. FLEET aims to develop superfluid devices that operate at room temperature, without the need for expensive, energy-intensive cooling. Approaches being used within FLEET’s include exciton–polariton bosonic condensation in atomically thin materials, topologically-protected exciton–polariton flow, and exciton superfluids in twin-layer materials. * Light-transformed materials: a material can be temporarily forced into a new state by applying an intense light beam. FLEET aims to study the fundamental physics behind this temporary state change. Approaches being pursued in FLEET include optically-induced Floquet topological states (topological states that change with time), nonequilibrium superfluidity and creation of topological states in multi- dimensional extensions of the kicked quantum rotor. These approaches are enabled by the following two technologies: *Atomically thin materials: FLEET seeks to find new ways of controlling the properties of two-dimensional materials via synthesis, substrates, and tuning electric and magnetic ordering. * Nanodevice fabrication: FLEET aims to work on new techniques to integrate novel atomically thin materials into high-quality device structures with suitable performance. \n",

      "answer: title: Bx1 benzoxazin1\n",
      "Function Maize gene for first step in biosynthesis of benzoxazin, which aids in resistance to insect pests, pathogenic fungi and bacteria. First report Hamilton 1964, as a mutant sensitive to the herbicide atrazine, and lacking benzoxazinoids (less than 1% of non-mutant plants). Molecular characterization reveals that the BX1 protein is a homologue to the alpha-subunit of tryptophan synthase. The reference mutant allele has a deletion of about 900 bp, located at the 5'-terminus and comprising sequence upstream of the transcription start site and the first exon. Additional alleles are given by a Mu transposon insertion in the fourth exon (Frey et al. 1997 ) and a Ds transposon insertion in the maize inbred line W22 genetic background (Betsiashvili et al. 2014). Gene sequence diversity analysis has been performed for 281 inbred lines of maize, and the results suggest that bx1 is responsible for much of the natural variation in DIMBOA (a benzoxazinoid compound) synthesis (Butron et al. 2010). Genetic variation in benzoxazinoid content influences maize resistance to several insect pests (Meihls et al 2013; McMullen et al 2009). \n",
      " Map location \n",
      " AB chromosome translocation analyses place on short arm of chromosome 4 (4S; Simcox and Weber 1985 ). There is close linkage to other genes in the benzoxazinoid synthesis pathway [bx2, bx3, bx4, bx5 Frey et al. 1995, 1997 ). Gene bx1 is 2490 bp from bx2 (Frey et al. 1997 ); between umc123 and agrc94 on 4S (Melanson et al. 1997 ). Mapping probes: SSR p-umc1022 (Sharopova et al. 2002 ); Overgo (physical map probe) PCO06449 (Gardiner et al. 2004 ). \n",
      " Phenotypes \n",
      " Mutants are viable, but may be distinguished from normal plants by FeCl3 staining: plants able to synthesize benzoxinoids have pale blue color when crushed and treated with FeCl3 solutions (Hamilton 1964, Simcox 1993 ). Mutations in the bx1 gene reduce the resistance to first generation European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) that is conferred by benzoxazinoids (Klun et al 1970 ). Bx1 mutant maize deposited less callose in response to chitosan elicitation than isogenic wildtype plants (Ahmad et al. 2011 ). Genetic mapping using recombinant inbred lines derived from maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 showed that a 3.9 kb cis-regulatory element that is located approximately 140 kb upstream of Bx1 causes higher 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA) accumulation in Mo17 than in B73 seedlings (Zheng et al. 2015 ). This genetic variation is also associated with higher corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) reproduction on B73 compared to Mo17 maize seedlings (Betsiashvili et al. 2014 ). Relative to maize inbred line W22, Bx1::Ds mutant maize plants are more sensitive to corn leaf aphids (Rhopalosiphum maidis) (Betsiashvili et al. 2014) and beet armyworms (Spodoptera exigua) (Tzin et al. 2017 ). Highly localized induction of benzoxazinoid accumulation in response to Egyptian cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) feeding is abolished in a maize bx1 mutant (Maag et al. 2016 ). \n",

The enzyme is called indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase, chloroplast, EC 4.1.2.8 and is located in the chloroplast. The X-ray structure of BX1 protein has been resolved and compared with bacterial TSA (tryptophan synthase alpha subunit, Kulik et al. 2005). Three homologs of the BX1 protein occur in maize. One is encoded by the gene tsa1, tryptophan synthase alpha1(Frey et al. 1997, Melanson et al. 1997 ), on chromosome 7, another by igl1, indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase1(Frey et al. 1997, on chromosome 1, and another by tsah1, 'TSA like\" and located near the bx1 gene (Frey et al. 1997. ). \n",

      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Biological Stain Commission\n",
      "The Biological Stain Commission (BSC) is an organization that provides third- party testing and certification of dyes and a few other compounds that are used to enhance contrast in specimens examined in biological and medical laboratories. The BSC is a 95-year-old organization well known to many thousands of scientists, worldwide but especially in N America, who buy BSC- certified stains for staining microscopic preparations and for making selective culture media for bacteria. Manufacturers and other vendors submit samples from their batches of dyes to the BSC's independent laboratory in Rochester NY. The BSC's certification label on a bottle of dye indicates that the contents are from a batch that passed the tests for chemical purity and for efficacy as a biological stain. These tests are published (Penney et al. 2002a). Changes to tests and additions to the list of stains eligible for certification are published from time to time in Biotechnic & Histochemistry and are summarized on the commission's web site.https://biologicalstaincommission.org/whats-new-3/ The BSC is a non- profit organization, incorporated in the State of New York, for the purpose of ensuring a supply of high quality stains (mostly dyes) for use in biological and medical laboratories. Its origins date from 1922, when vendors of biological stains in the USA had exhausted their stocks of pre-war dyes imported from Germany. American dye manufacturers were unable to produce products that were consistently reliable in histological microtechnique and bacteriology (Conn 1980–1981; Penney 2000). The commission's testing laboratory was initially at the Agriculture Experimental Station in Geneva, NY, directed by Harold J. Conn.http://www.twu.edu/dsc/connI.htm | Deaf Scientists Corner Since 1947 the laboratory has been located at the University of Rochester Medical College, Rochester, NY. Currently 57 individual dyes and about 5 mixtures of different dyes are eligible for testing and certification by the BSC. The assays and other tests used in the commission's laboratory are all published, making the required standards known to both vendors and users of biological stains (Penney et al. 2002a,b). The commission's web site includes instructions for submitting samples of stains for testing and certification. Since 1925 the BSC has published a scientific journal, named Stain Technology until 1991, when the name was changed to Biotechnic & Histochemistry.Biotechnic & Histochemistry, Informa Healthcare Biological Stains, a book about the chemistry, testing and applications of dyes and other colorants in biology and medicine, has been published by the BSC since 1925. The first seven editions (1925-1961) were by H. J. Conn. The eighth and ninth editions (1969, 1977), retitled Conn's Biological Stains, were by Ralph Dougall Lillie, who added many dyes and chromogenic reagents and provided extensive tables of data for classification, nomenclature and solubilities of dyes. The tenth and most recent edition of the book (edited by Horobin & Kiernan 2002) has 28 chapters by multiple authors; 18 are by Horobin alone. The BSC has also sponsored three editions of History of Staining, originally by Conn and later by Clark and Kasten. Education about stains is another mission of the BSC. Questions sent in by way of the BSC's website are passed on to appropriate experts and answered privately by email, usually within a few days. This free service provides confidential information to users, vendors and manufacturers, and also informs the BSC about current problems. In December 2018 the BSC added to its website an online glossary of hundreds of words and short phrases used in the field of biological staining. This was revised and enlarged in 2021 and 2023. The annual meetings of the BSC are usually held on the first or second weekend in June, in cities easily accessible by air from major centers in North America and Europe. These meetings include scientific sessions with presentations by invited speakers in such disciplines as cancer biology, neuroscience, pathology and plant sciences. There are also informal presentations and exchanges of information among academic biologists, medical scientists, pathologists, and representatives of companies that manufacture and sell biological stains. The invited presentations planned for meetings in 2020 and 2021 were postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2023 Symposium marks the Commission's centennial year \n",

      " *Blip (Voiced by Matt Murray) - The main protagonist and one of the title characters. Blip is a bumbling Civi-Bot who attempts to keep within societal norms, but isn't very successful. He is best friend and roommate to the wacky Bolts, and often must drag his impulsive friend out of trouble. He is the more mature, level-headed of the duo. He along with Bolts were accidentally drafted into the Lunar League's bottom team, The Thunderbolts. He has a huge crush on Saedee, who spends most of the series ignoring his displays of affection, while occasionally letting slip possible mutual feelings, before revealing in the season finale she too loves Blip. Late in the series he is revealed to be Dr. Tommy's Secret Bot, and has latent powers, which he calls his \"Super Mode\"; in this state he is taller, stronger, faster, and can fly. He has a pet mouse like robot named Squeaker, who prior to undergoing training was very violent and attacked everyone, But nowadays he only attacks Bolts. *Bolts/Blood's Bot/Darth Boltor (Voiced by Terry McGurrin) - The secondary protagonist and one of the two title characters. Bolts is immature, impulsive and has a talent for getting himself into trouble; including one time where he put himself under huge debt to a Robot Mafia Leader Vinnie Two-Chimes, after losing a bet in a (fixed) sock fight match. But he does occasionally show he has some common sense as seen in Little Squeaker when he thinks it's a bad idea to show Squeaker around to the Thunderbolts after Squeaker viciously attacked both him and Saedee's housewarming present. He also shows some signs of intelligence and ingenuity as also seen in little Squeaker when he modified an illegal weapon to bring up to legal standards only to have his talented creation shot down by Gridiron telling the sport was a croquet sport match and not a battle. He's the team's jokester and often drives Coach Gridiron insane. He once entered a secret (and illegal) wrestling tournament under the name Bolto de Fuego (a play on Bola de Fuego), and has continued using the name Boltor as his screen name. Like Blip he has latent powers, where his eyes will turn red and he gains monstrous strength. He is eventually revealed to be \"Blood's Bot\", the ultimate creation of Dr. Blood. \n",
      "Supporting characters\n",
      " *Saedee (Voiced by Melissa Altro) - The gorgeous heroine Saedee, who is Captain of the Thunderbolts. She is a prototype model from her production line, and as a result has a habit of malfunctioning, usually in the form of her legs involuntarily kicking or falling off. Blip has a huge crush on her, and while her feelings are mutual she tries very hard to hide this, instead lusting over Tigrr Jaxxon. *Coach Gridiron (Voiced by Patrick Garrow) - Short-tempered and combustible, Coach Gridiron employs harsh training routines in an attempt to bolster their bottom placed ranking, however deep down, behind all the raging steam he can be compassionate and understanding. His head has a habit of steaming and blowing off. *Tigrr Jaxxon (voiced by Glenn Coulson) - The star player of the Lunar League. He is on the All Stars team, which (unsurprisingly) are the top of the Lunar League. He is very arrogant and prideful, but (as many find out over the course of the series) he isn't very bright. In the episode, \"Tigrr By The Tail\", it also revealed he is secretly a coward. He was initially implied to be Blood's Bot, but the team investigate and discover otherwise. His name is a reference to Tiger Jackson. *Dr. Arthur Blood (Voiced by Colin Fox) - The main antagonist of the series, he is an evil human scientist who was formally colleague to Dr. Tommy. He is usually seen in a hover-chair with his back facing the camera. He created the Bloodbots, who all look the same, and are devoid of emotion, designed only for violence. He reorganized into the first Galactic Shadow Empire *D-Gor - Dr. Arthur Blood's unfortunate servant, who is a parody of Igor. Like Igor he is deformed, and hunched. Dr. Blood likes to use him as a means of venting his anger, by yelling at him or smashing his fist on top of his head (shown in the Opening Sequence). \n",
      "Minor and recurring characters\n",
      " * Steve (voiced by Jonathan Wilson) – The diminutive, long-suffering assistant to Coach Gridiron. Steve is constantly overlooked and scorned by his peers, due to his diminutive size and incompetence. Steve is very short, speaks with an English accent, and has a single wheel in place of legs. When he isn't slaving for the team's every whim, he secretly plots elevating his own status, wanting Coach Gridiron's job. He has a particularly hostile relationship with Bolts, and they have physical confrontations on several occasions, especially during the time when he and Bolts both entered in the wrestling tournament (under the guise the Silver Steve), with him and Bolts being the main attractions. * Welder (voiced by Martin Julien) – A gentle giant, who longs for days when he was younger and shinier. * Ratch-8 (voiced by Paul Wensley) – A teammate on the Thunderbolts. His name is a pun on the word \"ratchet\". * The Reformatter – A fearsome monstrous machine who captures robots and remakes them into electronic appliances. He is feared by all robots in the Lunar League. Blip once says: \"No one has ever gone inside and come out looking the same.\" * Dr. Tommy (voiced by Dwayne Hill) - He is the genius doctor who created every Robot living on the moon, with the exception of the Blood-bots and Blood's Bot (a robot created by Dr. Blood as his secret weapon). He also created the Dr. Tommy's bot (revealed to be Blip) and the mysterious Black Box, which has many untold powers. He and Dr. Blood were formerly colleagues, but upon discovering Blood's evil plans of world domination, turned on him. He appears mostly in flashbacks throughout the series, and finally appears in person in the Season Finale, where his face is finally revealed. * The Blood Bots - Dr. Blood's shock troops. They all look exactly the same; red (with Dr. Blood's patterns), rounded, a single glowing slit for eyes, speaking in robotic monotone voices, mounted cannons instead of left hands, and they hover above the ground (lacking feet). They seem to be devoid of emotion, other than that of unquestioningly obeying Dr. Blood's every command. It is explained by Dr. Tommy this is because unlike his robots, the Blood-bots have no hearts. This also gives rise to them being very socially inept. They are despised by every team in the Lunar League. * Klank Lockton and Lock Clankton (both voiced by Dwayne Hillhttp:) - The two robot announcers for the Lunar League. Clank Lockton is obnoxious and overbearing, always hogging the screen and putting down his fellow announcer Lock Clankton. Lock virtually never gets the chance to talk or announce anything, as any of his attempts always result in Clank pushing him aside. His voice is heard in episodes 4, 24, and especially 26, when he announces the final showdown between the robots and Dr. Blood. * Vinnie Two-Chimes – The fearsome robot mob-boss, who is in fact a tiny, primitively designed, box-shaped robot on two wheels. He completely lacks human features (no head, arms, legs), only possessing two blinking lights and communicates via beeps. He is however in charge of two towering robot henchman who do his dirty work. He has scammed Bolts on numerous occasions, and for a large portion of the series Bolts has been in debt to him. A running gag is Bolts' endless, vain attempts to acquire money to pay off his never ending debt. * Motbot – A shady bot who has a habit of hiding in trash cans, he is Blip's link to his secret origins, and acts as his mentor, guiding him to his destiny as Dr. Tommy's Secret Bot. * The Schleprechauns – Robot Leprechauns who scavenge for scrap metal to turn into Goldium, a highly prized element able to enhance any electronic device's functions and capabilities. * Helsing-V – A vampire hunter, and a parody of Van Helsing. He appears when Dr. Blood unleashes a Robot-Vampire Virus that infects the whole Thunderbolts team, and teams up with Blip to fight the Robot-Vampires and find a cure. He also made an appearance in the season finale. He has a habit of throwing smoke bombs and disappearing in mysterious puffs of smoke. * Supreme Ambassador Garry – The man in control of Earth Command, he does what he likes from getting Gridiron re-programmed to helping organise the goings on in Lunar City. A rather overbearing and demeaning person, he'll often disregard his responsibilities in favour of a good game of golf. \n",

      "answer: title: Bioconversion\n",
      "Bioconversion, also known as biotransformation, is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or energy sources by biological processes or agents, such as certain microorganisms. One example is the industrial production of cortisone, which one step is the bioconversion of progesterone to 11-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone by Rhizopus nigricans. Another example is the bioconversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol, which is part of scientific research for many decades. Another example of bioconversion is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or energy sources by biological processes or agents, such as certain microorganisms, some detritivores or enzymes. In the US, the Bioconversion Science and Technology group performs multidisciplinary R&D; for the Department of Energy's (DOE) relevant applications of bioprocessing, especially with biomass. Bioprocessing combines the disciplines of chemical engineering, microbiology and biochemistry. The Group 's primary role is investigation of the use of microorganism, microbial consortia and microbial enzymes in bioenergy research. New cellulosic ethanol conversion processes have enabled the variety and volume of feedstock that can be bioconverted to expand rapidly. Feedstock now includes materials derived from plant or animal waste such as paper, auto-fluff, tires, fabric, construction materials, municipal solid waste (MSW), sludge, sewage, etc. \n",
      "Three different processes for bioconversion\n",
      " 1 - Enzymatic hydrolysis - a single source of feedstock, switchgrass for example, is mixed with strong enzymes which convert a portion of cellulosic material into sugars which can then be fermented into ethanol. Genencor and Novozymes are two companies that have received United States government Department of Energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulase, a key enzyme in the production cellulosic ethanol by this process. 2 - Synthesis gas fermentation - a blend of feedstock, not exceeding 30% water, is gasified in a closed environment into a syngas containing mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The cooled syngas is then converted into usable products through exposure to bacteria or other catalysts. BRI Energy, LLC is a company whose pilot plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas is currently using synthesis gas fermentation to convert a variety of waste into ethanol. After gasification, anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium ljungdahlii) are used to convert the syngas (CO, CO2, and H2) into ethanol. The heat generated by gasification is also used to co- generate excess electricity. 3 - C.O.R.S. and Grub Composting are sustainable technologies that employ organisms that feed on organic matter to reduce and convert organic waste in to high quality feedstuff and oil rich material for the biodiesel industry. Organizations pioneering this novel approach to waste management are EAWAG, ESR International, Prota Culture and BIOCONVERSION that created the e-CORS® system to meet large scale organic waste management needs and environmental sustainability in both urban and livestock farming reality. This type of engineered system introduces a substantial innovation represented by the automatic modulation of the treatment, able to adapt conditions of the system to the biology of the scavenger used, improving their performances and the power of this technology. \n",

      "answer: title: Brachytherapy\n",
      "Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy where a sealed radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Brachy is Greek for short. Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical, prostate, breast, esophageal and skin cancer and can also be used to treat tumours in many other body sites. Treatment results have demonstrated that the cancer-cure rates of brachytherapy are either comparable to surgery and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or are improved when used in combination with these techniques. Brachytherapy can be used alone or in combination with other therapies such as surgery, EBRT and chemotherapy. Brachytherapy contrasts with unsealed source radiotherapy, in which a therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT), in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma- rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes, iodine-125 or cesium-131 for instance) directly at the site of the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues. A course of brachytherapy can be completed in less time than other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer- cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well. The global market for brachytherapy reached US$680 million in 2013, of which the high-dose rate (HDR) and LDR segments accounted for 70%. Microspheres and electronic brachytherapy comprised the remaining 30%. One analysis predicts that the brachytherapy market may reach over US$2.4 billion in 2030, growing by 8% annually, mainly driven by the microspheres market as well as electronic brachytherapy, which is gaining significant interest worldwide as a user-friendly technology. \n",
      "Medical uses\n",
      " thumb|upright=1.5|Body sites in which brachytherapy can be used to treat cancer Brachytherapy is commonly used to treat cancers of the cervix, prostate, breast, and skin. Brachytherapy can also be used in the treatment of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), digestive tract (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, vagina, vulva), and soft tissues. As the radiation sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high dose of radiation to be applied to a small area. Furthermore, because the radiation sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function. The use of HDR brachytherapy enables overall treatment times to be reduced compared with EBRT. Patients receiving brachytherapy generally have to make fewer visits for radiotherapy compared with EBRT, and overall radiotherapy treatment plans can be completed in less time. Many brachytherapy procedures are performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience may be particularly relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, to ensure that they have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics. Brachytherapy can be used with the aim of curing the cancer in cases of small or locally advanced tumours, provided the cancer has not metastasized (spread to other parts of the body). In appropriately selected cases, brachytherapy for primary tumours often represents a comparable approach to surgery, achieving the same probability of cure and with similar side effects. However, in locally advanced tumours, surgery may not routinely provide the best chance of cure and is often not technically feasible to perform. In these cases radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, offers the only chance of cure. In more advanced disease stages, brachytherapy can be used as palliative treatment for symptom relief from pain and bleeding. In cases where the tumour is not easily accessible or is too large to ensure an optimal distribution of irradiation to the treatment area, brachytherapy can be combined with other treatments, such as EBRT and/or surgery. Combination therapy of brachytherapy exclusively with chemotherapy is rare. \n",
      "Cervical cancer\n",
      " Brachytherapy is commonly used in the treatment of early or locally confined cervical cancer and is a standard of care in many countries. Cervical cancer can be treated with either LDR, PDR or HDR brachytherapy. Used in combination with EBRT, brachytherapy can provide better outcomes than EBRT alone. The precision of brachytherapy enables a high dose of targeted radiation to be delivered to the cervix, while minimising radiation exposure to adjacent tissues and organs. The chances of staying free of disease (disease-free survival) and of staying alive (overall survival) are similar for LDR, PDR and HDR treatments. However, a key advantage of HDR treatment is that each dose can be delivered on an outpatient basis with a short administration time providing greater convenience for many patients. Research shows locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix must be treated with a combination of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and intracavity brachytherapy (ICBT). \n",
      "Prostate cancer\n",
      " Brachytherapy to treat prostate cancer can be given either as permanent LDR seed implantation or as temporary HDR brachytherapy. Permanent seed implantation is suitable for patients with a localised tumour and good prognosis and has been shown to be a highly effective treatment to prevent the cancer from returning. The survival rate is similar to that found with EBRT or surgery (radical prostatectomy), but with fewer side effects such as impotence and incontinence. The procedure can be completed quickly and patients are usually able to go home on the same day of treatment and return to normal activities after one to two days. Permanent seed implantation is often a less invasive treatment option compared to the surgical removal of the prostate. Temporary HDR brachytherapy is a newer approach to treating prostate cancer, but is currently less common than seed implantation. It is predominantly used to provide an extra dose in addition to EBRT (known as \"boost\" therapy) as it offers an alternative method to deliver a high dose of radiation therapy that conforms to the shape of the tumour within the prostate, while sparing radiation exposure to surrounding tissues. HDR brachytherapy as a boost for prostate cancer also means that the EBRT course can be shorter than when EBRT is used alone. \n",
      "Breast cancer\n",
      " Radiation therapy is standard of care for women who have undergone lumpectomy or mastectomy surgery, and is an integral component of breast-conserving therapy. Brachytherapy can be used after surgery, before chemotherapy or palliatively in the case of advanced disease. Brachytherapy to treat breast cancer is usually performed with HDR temporary brachytherapy. Post surgery, breast brachytherapy can be used as a \"boost\" following whole breast irradiation (WBI) using EBRT. More recently, brachytherapy alone is used to deliver APBI (accelerated partial breast irradiation), involving delivery of radiation to only the immediate region surrounding the original tumour. The main benefit of breast brachytherapy compared to whole breast irradiation is that a high dose of radiation can be precisely applied to the tumour while sparing radiation to healthy breast tissues and underlying structures such as the ribs and lungs. APBI can typically be completed over the course of a week. The option of brachytherapy may be particularly important in ensuring that working women, the elderly or women without easy access to a treatment centre, are able to benefit from breast-conserving therapy due to the short treatment course compared with WBI (which often requires more visits over the course of 1–2 months). There are five methods that can be used to deliver breast brachytherapy: Interstitial breast brachytherapy, Intracavitary breast brachytherapy, Intraoperative radiation therapy, Permanent Breast Seed Implantation and non-invasive breast brachytherapy using mammography for target localization and an HDR source. \n",
      "=Interstitial breast brachytherapy\n",
      "= Interstitial breast brachytherapy involves the temporary placement of several flexible plastic catheters in the breast tissue. These are carefully positioned to allow optimal targeting of radiation to the treatment area while sparing the surrounding breast tissue. The catheters are connected to an afterloader, which delivers the planned radiation dose to the treatment area. Interstitial breast brachytherapy can be used as \"boost\" after EBRT, or as APBI. \n",
      "= Intraoperative radiation therapy \n",
      "= Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) delivers radiation at the same time as the surgery to remove the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates radiation (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. Radiation is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing the incision. \n",
      "=Intracavitary breast brachytherapy\n",
      "= Intracavitary breast brachytherapy (also known as \"balloon brachytherapy\") involves the placement of a single catheter into the breast cavity left after the removal of the tumour (lumpectomy). The catheter can be placed at the time of the lumpectomy or postoperatively. Via the catheter, a balloon is then inflated in the cavity. The catheter is then connected to an afterloader, which delivers the radiation dose through the catheter and into the balloon. Currently, intracavitary breast brachytherapy is only routinely used for APBI. There are also devices that combine the features of interstitial and intracavitary breast brachytherapy (e.g. SAVI). These devices use multiple catheters but are inserted through a single-entry point in the breast. Studies suggest the use of multiple catheters enables physicians to target the radiation more precisely. \n",
      "= Permanent breast seed implantation \n",
      "= Permanent breast seed implantation (PBSI) implants many radioactive \"seeds\" (small pellets) into the breast in the area surrounding the site of the tumour, similar to permanent seed prostate brachytherapy. The seeds are implanted in a single 1–2 hour procedure and deliver radiation over the following months as the radioactive material inside them decays. Risk of radiation from the implants to others (e.g. partner/spouse) has been studied and found to be safe. \n",
      "Brain tumors\n",
      " Surgically Targeted Radiation Therapy (STaRT), branded as GammaTile Therapy, is a type of brachytherapy implant specifically designed for use inside the brain. GammaTile is FDA-cleared to treat newly diagnosed, operable malignant intracranial neoplasms (i.e., brain tumors) and operable recurrent intracranial neoplasms, including meningiomas, metastases, high-grade gliomas, and glioblastomas. Summary In a clinical study, GammaTile Therapy improved local tumor control compared to previous same-site treatments without an increased risk of side effects. \n",
      " Esophageal cancer \n",
      " For esophageal cancer radiation treatment, brachytherapy is one option for effective treatment, involves definitive radiotherapy (boost) or palliative treatments. Definitive radiotherapy (boost) can deliver the dose precisely and palliative treatments can be given to relieve dysphagia. The large diameter applicators or balloon type catheter are used with the afterloader to expand the esophagus and facilitate the delivery of radiation dose to tumor with sparing of nearby normal tissue. Brachytherapy followed EBRT or surgery have been shown to improve the survival rate and local recurrent rate than EBRT or surgery only for esophageal cancer patients. \n",
      "Skin cancer\n",
      " HDR brachytherapy for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction. Various applicators can be used to ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of the skin and help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose. Another type of brachytherapy which has similar advantages as the HDR is provided be the Rhenium-SCT (Skin Cancer Therapy). It makes use of the beta ray emissions of Rhenium-188 to treat basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas. the radiation source is enclosed in a compound which is applied to a thin protective foil directly over the lesion. This way the radiation source can be applied to complex locations and minimize radiation to healthy tissue. Brachytherapy for skin cancer provides good cosmetic results and clinical efficacy; studies with up to five years follow-up have shown that brachytherapy is highly effective in terms of local control, and is comparable to EBRT. Treatment times are typically short, providing convenience for patients. It has been suggested that brachytherapy may become a standard of treatment for skin cancer in the near future. \n",
      "Blood vessels\n",
      " Brachytherapy can be used in the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis, in which a catheter is placed inside blood vessels, through which sources are inserted and removed. In treating In-stent restenosis (ISR) Drug Eluting stents (DES) have been found to be superior to Intracoronary Brachytherapy (ICBT). However, there is continued interest in vascular brachytherapy for persistent restenosis in failed stents and vein grafts. The therapy has also been investigated for use in the treatment of peripheral vasculature stenosis and considered for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. \n",
      "Side effects\n",
      " The likelihood and nature of potential acute, sub-acute or long-term side-effects associated with brachytherapy depends on the location of the tumour being treated and the type of brachytherapy being used. \n",
      "Acute\n",
      " Acute side effects associated with brachytherapy include localised bruising, swelling, bleeding, discharge or discomfort within the implanted region. These usually resolve within a few days following completion of treatment. Patients may also feel fatigued for a short period following treatment. Brachytherapy treatment for cervical or prostate cancer can cause acute and transient urinary symptoms such as urinary retention, urinary incontinence or painful urination (dysuria). Transient increased bowel frequency, diarrhoea, constipation or minor rectal bleeding may also occur. Acute and subacute side effects usually resolve over a matter of days or a few weeks. In the case of permanent (seed) brachytherapy for prostate cancer, there is a small chance that some seeds may migrate out of the treatment region into the bladder or urethra and be passed in the urine. Brachytherapy for skin cancer may result in a shedding of the outer layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer is located on the lip, ulceration may occur as a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks. Most of the acute side effects associated with brachytherapy can be treated with medication or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once the treatment is completed. The acute side effects of HDR brachytherapy are broadly similar to EBRT. \n",
      "Long-term\n",
      " In a small number of people, brachytherapy may cause long-term side effects due to damage or disruption of adjacent tissues or organs. Long-term side effects are usually mild or moderate in nature. For example, urinary and digestive problems may persist as a result of brachytherapy for cervical or prostate cancer, and may require ongoing management. Brachytherapy for prostate cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15–30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, the majority of cases can successfully be treated with drugs such as Viagra. Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy. Brachytherapy for breast or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the treatment area. In the case of breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur as a result of fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become swollen and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients. \n",
      "Safety around others\n",
      " Patients often ask if they need to have special safety precautions around family and friends after receiving brachytherapy. If temporary brachytherapy is used, no radioactive sources remain in the body after treatment. Therefore, there is no radiation risk to friends or family from being in close proximity with them. If permanent brachytherapy is used, low dose radioactive sources (seeds) are left in the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women for a short time after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful. \n",
      "Types\n",
      " Different types of brachytherapy can be defined according to (1) the placement of the radiation sources in the target treatment area, (2) the rate or 'intensity' of the irradiation dose delivered to the tumour, and (3) the duration of dose delivery. \n",
      "Source placement\n",
      " The two main types of brachytherapy treatment in terms of the placement of the radioactive source are interstitial and contact. In the case of interstitial brachytherapy, the sources are placed directly in the target tissue of the affected site, such as the prostate or breast. Contact brachytherapy involves placement of the radiation source in a space next to the target tissue. This space may be a body cavity (intracavitary brachytherapy) such as the cervix, uterus or vagina; a body lumen (intraluminal brachytherapy) such as the trachea or oesophagus; or externally (surface brachytherapy) such as the skin. A radiation source can also be placed in blood vessels (intravascular brachytherapy) for the treatment of coronary in-stent restenosis. \n",
      "Dose rate\n",
      " The dose rate of brachytherapy refers to the level or 'intensity' with which the radiation is delivered to the surrounding medium and is expressed in Grays per hour (Gy/h). Low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy involves implanting radiation sources that emit radiation at a rate of up to 2 Gy·h−1. LDR brachytherapy is commonly used for cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, sarcomas and prostate cancer Medium-dose rate (MDR) brachytherapy is characterized by a medium rate of dose delivery, ranging between 2 Gy·h−1 to 12 Gy·h−1. High-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy is when the rate of dose delivery exceeds 12 Gy·h−1. The most common applications of HDR brachytherapy are in tumours of the cervix, esophagus, lungs, breasts and prostate. Most HDR treatments are performed on an outpatient basis, but this is dependent on the treatment site. Pulsed-dose rate (PDR) brachytherapy involves short pulses of radiation, typically once an hour, to simulate the overall rate and effectiveness of LDR treatment. Typical tumour sites treated by PDR brachytherapy are gynaecological and head and neck cancers. \n",
      "Duration of dose delivery\n",
      " The placement of radiation sources in the target area can be temporary or permanent. Temporary brachytherapy involves placement of radiation sources for a set duration (usually a number of minutes or hours) before being withdrawn. The specific treatment duration will depend on many different factors, including the required rate of dose delivery and the type, size and location of the cancer. In LDR and PDR brachytherapy, the source typically stays in place up to 24 hours before being removed, while in HDR brachytherapy this time is typically a few minutes. Permanent brachytherapy, also known as seed implantation, involves placing small LDR radioactive seeds or pellets (about the size of a grain of rice) in the tumour or treatment site and leaving them there permanently to gradually decay. Over a period of weeks or months, the level of radiation emitted by the sources will decline to almost zero. The inactive seeds then remain in the treatment site with no lasting effect. Permanent brachytherapy is most commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer. \n",
      "Procedure\n",
      " thumb|upright=1.75|Typical stages of a brachytherapy procedure \n",
      "Initial planning\n",
      " To accurately plan the brachytherapy procedure, a thorough clinical examination is performed to understand the characteristics of the tumour. In addition, a range of imaging modalities can be used to visualise the shape and size of the tumour and its relation to surrounding tissues and organs. These include x-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT or CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The data from many of these sources can be used to create a 3D visualisation of the tumour and the surrounding tissues. Using this information, a plan of the optimal distribution of the radiation sources can be developed. This includes consideration of how the source carriers (applicators), which are used to deliver the radiation to the treatment site, should be placed and positioned. Applicators are non-radioactive and are typically needles or plastic catheters. The specific type of applicator used will depend on the type of cancer being treated and the characteristics of the target tumour. This initial planning helps to ensure that 'cold spots' (too little irradiation) and 'hot spots' (too much irradiation) are avoided during treatment, as these can respectively result in treatment failure and side-effects. \n",
      "Insertion\n",
      " Before radioactive sources can be delivered to the tumour site, the applicators have to be inserted and correctly positioned in line with the initial planning. Imaging techniques, such as x-ray, fluoroscopy and ultrasound are typically used to help guide the placement of the applicators to their correct positions and to further refine the treatment plan. CAT scans and MRI can also be used. Once the applicators are inserted, they are held in place against the skin using sutures or adhesive tape to prevent them from moving. Once the applicators are confirmed as being in the correct position, further imaging can be performed to guide detailed treatment planning. \n",
      "Creation of a virtual patient\n",
      " thumb|Creation of a virtual patient to plan the delivery of brachytherapy The images of the patient with the applicators in situ are imported into treatment planning software and the patient is brought into a dedicated shielded room for treatment. The treatment planning software enables multiple 2D images of the treatment site to be translated into a 3D 'virtual patient', within which the position of the applicators can be defined. The spatial relationships between the applicators, the treatment site and the surrounding healthy tissues within this 'virtual patient' are a copy of the relationships in the actual patient. \n",
      "Optimizing the irradiation plan\n",
      " thumb|upright|Refinement of the treatment plan during a brachytherapy procedure To identify the optimal spatial and temporal distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation of the distribution of the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called 'dose-painting'. \n",
      "Treatment delivery\n",
      " The radiation sources used for brachytherapy are always enclosed within a non- radioactive capsule. The sources can be delivered manually, but are more commonly delivered through a technique known as 'afterloading'. Manual delivery of brachytherapy is limited to a few LDR applications, due to risk of radiation exposure to clinical staff. In contrast, afterloading involves the accurate positioning of non-radioactive applicators in the treatment site, which are subsequently loaded with the radiation sources. In manual afterloading, the source is delivered into the applicator by the operator. Remote afterloading systems provide protection from radiation exposure to healthcare professionals by securing the radiation source in a shielded safe. Once the applicators are correctly positioned in the patient, they are connected to an 'afterloader' machine (containing the radioactive sources) through a series of connecting guide tubes. The treatment plan is sent to the afterloader, which then controls the delivery of the sources along the guide tubes into the pre-specified positions within the applicator. This process is only engaged once staff are removed from the treatment room. The sources remain in place for a pre-specified length of time, again following the treatment plan, following which they are returned along the tubes to the afterloader. On completion of delivery of the radioactive sources, the applicators are carefully removed from the body. Patients typically recover quickly from the brachytherapy procedure, enabling it to often be performed on an outpatient basis. Between 2003 and 2012 in United States community hospitals, the rate of hospital stays with brachytherapy (internal radiation therapy) had a 24.4 percent average annual decrease among adults aged 45–64 years and a 27.3 percent average annual decrease among adults aged 65–84 years. Brachytherapy was the OR procedure with the greatest change in occurrence among hospital stays paid by Medicare and private insurance. \n",

      "History\n",
      " Brachytherapy dates back to 1901 (shortly after the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896) when Pierre Curie suggested to Henri-Alexandre Danlos that a radioactive source could be inserted into a tumour. It was found that the radiation caused the tumour to shrink. Independently, Alexander Graham Bell also suggested the use of radiation in this way. In the early twentieth century, techniques for the application of brachytherapy were pioneered at the Curie institute in Paris by Danlos and at St Luke's and Memorial Hospital in New York by Robert Abbe. Working with the Curies in their radium research laboratory at the University of Paris, American physicist William Duane refined a technique for extracting radon-222 gas from radium sulfate solutions. Solutions containing 1 gram of radium were \"milked\" to create radon \"seeds\" of about 20 millicuries each. These \"seeds\" were distributed throughout Paris for use in an early form of brachytherapy named endocurietherapy. Duane perfected this \"milking\" technique during his time in Paris and referred to the device as a \"radium cow\". Duane returned to the United States in 1913 and worked in a joint role as assistant professor of physics at Harvard and Research Fellow in Physics of the Harvard Cancer Commission. The Cancer Commission was founded in 1901 and hired Duane to investigate the usage of radium emanations in the treatment of cancer. In 1915 he built Boston's first \"radium cow\" and thousands of patients were treated with the radon-222 generated from it. Interstitial radium therapy was common in the 1930s. Gold seeds filled with radon were used as early as 1942 until at least 1958. Gold shells were selected by Gino Failla around 1920 to shield beta rays while passing gamma rays. Cobalt needles were also used briefly after World War II. Radon and cobalt were replaced by radioactive tantalum and gold, before iridium rose in prominence. First used in 1958, iridium is the most commonly used artificial source for brachytherapy today. Following initial interest in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use declined in the middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in three- dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today. The word \"brachytherapy\" comes from the Greek word , meaning \"short-distance\" or \"short\". \n",
      "Environmental hazard\n",
      " Due to the small size of brachytherapy sources and low control in early decades, there is a risk that some of these have escaped into the environment to become orphaned sources. A radium needle was found in a Prague playground in 2011, radiating 500 µSv/h from one metre away. \n",

      " Set in the year 2090, the book depicts a future world where global warming has caused sea level to rise considerably. The Highlands of Scotland are the only unsubmerged part of Britain – the Highlands now being known as the Drylands. Damage to the ozone layer has resulted in much higher levels of UV light and so sunburn and skin cancer are serious issues – most people do not venture outside unless entirely necessary, and carry high factor suncream and anti-cancer kits. Most of the world's population were wiped out in \"God's flood\"; the survivors live in collections of floating oil-platform- like city structures, known as parishes. The story takes place around the seas and drylands that were once Scotland – initially Port, a collection of parishes (named after towns around Scotland) attached to what was once Greenock by underwater cables. The Population of Port are watched constantly by a totalitarian government; there are class divides in the parishes (there is an underclass of Danish refugees living in many of the lower levels); the climate of Earth is now inhospitable. In addition to these problems, Senga, a new strain of HIV, infects much of the population. There is no cure, and the entire population is infected with the Mowdy virus (similar to HIV) and are dependent on government issued medication to suppress Senga. Senga also becomes active if individuals engage in sex – reproduction is performed using laboratory techniques, and only virtual sex is possible. Anyone who develops Senga is put into isolation for the virus to run its course – these people are kistit – entombed in capsules in huge hospitals.

      " In the 2000s the application of the bulk material analyzer was extended to include minerals. Today, analyzers are found in copper, iron ore, and phosphates, to name a few. One of the advantages of these analyzers is the timeliness of information for the user. Another is the avoidance of physical sampling. \n",
      "Technology\n",
      " The technology most frequently found in bulk material analysis and coal analysis are PFTNA (Pulsed Fast Thermal Neutron Activation), the prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) and Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). PFTNA and PGNAA technology rely on activation of the material on the conveyor belt by neutrons, and the instantaneous emission of gamma rays from nuclei which have absorbed neutrons. Capitalizing on the unique gamma ray spectrum associated with each element, the instrument can perform an analysis each minute on the composite spectrum to determine the overall elemental composition of the material. LIBS operate by focusing the laser onto a small area at the surface of the material forming a plasma plume. When plasma quickly cools down the atomic emission lines of the elements can be observed using optical spectrometer. Based on obtained spectra quantitative chemical analysis of the sample is performed. \n",

      "Early life and education\n",
      " Bryson was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, the son of Bill Bryson Sr., a sports journalist who worked for 50 years at the Des Moines Register, and Agnes Mary (née McGuire), the home furnishings editor at the same newspaper. His mother was of Irish descent. He had an older brother, Michael (1942–2012), and a sister, Mary Jane Elizabeth. In 2006, Bryson published The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, a humorous account of his childhood years in Des Moines. In 2006 Frank Cownie, the mayor of Des Moines awarded Bryson the key to the city and announced that 21 October 2006 would be \"Bill Bryson, The Thunderbolt Kid, Day.\" Bryson attended Drake University for two years before dropping out in 1972, deciding instead to backpack around Europe for four months. He returned to Europe the following year with a high school friend, Matt Angerer (the pseudonymous Stephen Katz). Bryson wrote about some of his experiences from the trip in his book Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe. \n",
      "Career\n",
      " thumb|Bryson in 2013 thumb|Bryson in 2013 Bryson first visited Great Britain in 1973 during his tour of Europe and decided to stay after securing a job working in a psychiatric hospital, the now-defunct Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, Surrey. He met a nurse there, Cynthia Billen, whom he married in 1975. They moved to Bryson's hometown of Des Moines, Iowa, in 1975 so Bryson could complete his degree at Drake University. In 1977 they settled in Britain. He worked as a journalist, first for the Bournemouth Evening Echo, eventually becoming chief copy editor of the business section of The Times and deputy national news editor of the business section of The Independent. The Brysons moved around the United Kingdom, living in Virginia Water (Surrey), Purewell (Dorset), Burton (Dorset), Kirkby Malham, and the Old Rectory in Wramplingham, Norfolk (2003–2013). They currently live in rural Hampshire and maintain a small flat in South Kensington, London. From 1995 to 2003 they lived in Hanover, New Hampshire. Although able to apply for British citizenship, Bryson said in 2010 that he had declined a citizenship test, declaring himself \"too cowardly\" to take it. However, in 2014, he said that he was preparing to take it and in the prologue to his 2015 book The Road to Little Dribbling: More Notes From a Small Island he describes doing so, in Eastleigh. His citizenship ceremony took place in Winchester and he now holds dual citizenship. \n",
      "Writings\n",
      " While living in the U.S. in the 1990s, Bryson wrote a column for a British newspaper for several years, reflecting on humorous aspects of his repatriation in the United States. These columns were selected and adapted to become his book I'm a Stranger Here Myself, alternatively titled Notes from a Big Country in Britain, Canada, and Australia. During his time in the US, Bryson decided to walk the Appalachian Trail with his friend Stephen Katz (a pseudonym), about which he wrote the book A Walk in the Woods. In the 2015 film adaptation of A Walk in the Woods, Bryson is portrayed by Academy Award winner Robert Redford, and Katz by Nick Nolte. In 2003, in conjunction with World Book Day, British voters chose Bryson's book Notes from a Small Island as that which best summed up British identity and the state of the nation. Also in 2003, he was appointed a Commissioner for English Heritage. His popular science book, the 500-page A Short History of Nearly Everything, explores not only the histories and current statuses of the sciences, but also their humble and often humorous beginnings. Although one \"top scientist\" is alleged to have jokingly described the book as \"annoyingly free of mistakes,\" Bryson himself makes no such claim, and a list of some of its reported errors is available online. In November 2006, Bryson interviewed then British prime minister Tony Blair on the state of science and education. Bryson also wrote two popular works on the history of the English language, The Mother Tongue and Made in America—and, more recently, an update of his guide to usage, Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words (first published as The Penguin Dictionary of Troublesome Words in 1983). He also released a podcast, Bill Bryson's Appliance of Science, in 2017. \n",
      "Litigation\n",
      " In 2012, Bryson sued his agent, Jed Mattes Inc., in New York County Supreme Court, claiming it had \"failed to perform some of the most fundamental duties of an agent.\" The case was settled out of court, with part of the settlement being that Bryson may not discuss it. In 2013, Bryson claimed copyright on an interview he had given nearly 20 years previously, after the interviewer republished it as an 8000-word e-book. Amazon removed the e-book from publication. \n",
      "Awards, positions and honours\n",
      " In 2004, he won the Aventis Prize for best general science book that year, with A Short History of Nearly Everything. In 2005, the book won the European Union's Descartes Prize for science communication. In 2005, he received the President's Award from the Royal Society of Chemistry for advancing the cause of the chemical sciences. In 2007, he won the Bradford Washburn Award, from the Museum of Science in Boston, for contributions to the popularization of science. In 2005, Bryson was appointed chancellor of Durham University, succeeding the late Sir Peter Ustinov. He had praised Durham as \"a perfect little city\" in Notes from a Small Island. With the Royal Society of Chemistry, the Bill Bryson Prize for Science Communication was established in 2005. The competition engages students from around the world in explaining science to non-experts. As part of its 350th anniversary celebrations in 2010 the Royal Society commissioned Bryson to edit a collection of essays by scientists and science writers about the history of science and the Royal Society over the previous three and a half centuries entitled Seeing Further. He was made an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his contribution to literature on 13 December 2006. In 2007, he was awarded the James Joyce Award by the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin. After he received British citizenship, his OBE was made substantive. In May 2007, he became the president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England. His first focus in this role was the establishment of an anti- littering campaign across England. He discussed the future of the countryside with Richard Mabey, Sue Clifford, Nicholas Crane, and Richard Girling at CPRE's Volunteer Conference in November 2007. In 2011, Bryson won the Golden Eagle Award from the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild. In October 2010, it was announced that Bryson would step down at the end of 2011. In 2012, he received the Kenneth B. Myer Award, from the Florey Institute of Neuroscience, in Melbourne, Australia. On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the Main Library the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th chancellor (2005–2011). The library also has a cafe named after Bryson's book Notes from a Small Island. Bryson was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2013, biographical text reproduced here was originally published by the Royal Society under a creative commons license becoming the first non-Briton to receive this honour. His biography at the Society reads: > Bill Bryson is a popular author who is driven by a deep curiosity for the > world we live in.

      "original_text: What is the aim of Cognitive Behavioral Training (CBTraining)?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Cognitive behavioral training\n",
      "Cognitive behavioral training (CBTraining), sometimes referred to as structured cognitive behavioral training, (SCBT) is an organized process that uses systematic, highly-structured tasks designed to improve cognitive functions. Functions such as working memory, decision making, and attention are thought to inform whether a person defaults to an impulsive behavior or a premeditated behavior. The aim of CBTraining is to affect a person's decision- making process and cause them to choose the premeditated behavior over the impulsive behavior in their everyday life. Through scheduled trainings that may be up to a few hours long and may be weekly or daily over a specific set of time, the goal of CBTraining is to show that focusing on repetitive, increasingly difficult cognitive tasks can transfer those skills to other cognitive processes in your brain, leading to behavioral change. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in this field with the invention of new technologies and a greater understanding of cognition in general. The roots of CBTraining lie in a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and general cognitive training. Cognitive training seeks to improve cognitive functions for the sake of improved brain processing ability. The basic premise of CBT is that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. Between those two mentalities lies the idea that in changing the way a person responds to stimulus through training, it is possible to change a person's actions. However, the positive effects of CBTraining have been difficult to prove throughout the field of research. Lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in many studies and a lack of a standardization of training methods and definitions of success make it difficult to compare studies with each other and find trends. Overall, many clinical reviews conclude that initial results expressing the benefits of CBTraining may have been overestimated, but the data shows positive enough results that continued research is encouraged. \n",
      "Description\n",
      " \n",
      " Methods \n",
      " Cognitive behavioral training (CBTraining) is a cognitive-based process designed with the aim to systematically break down emotionally driven dependencies and behaviors, replacing them with behaviors that are based on rational choice. Testing can be computerized or gamified. Bickel et al. describe this method of training as such, \"adaptive-training programs rely on computerized algorithms that adjust intervention content to a patient's skill level in realtime in order to tax participants at the limit of their capacity and maintain engagement during training.\" Nixon and Lewis note that programs which adjust to participants' skill levels are more successful at encouraging participants to complete trainings since the testing itself can be repetitive and uninteresting. Inhibitory control training (ICT) is a method of CBTraining, which uses cues paired with promoting or inhibiting stimulus to change behavior. These cues can be general or specific to an undesirable behavior and use Go/no go or Stop-Signal tests. An example of a cue-specific ICT test was used in Stice et al.'s study designed to limit unhealthy food consumption by combining inhibitory signals with images of unhealthy food more often than non-food- related images. Working memory training (WMT) is a method that targets working memory enhancements as a vehicle for changing behavior. Working memory is \"the ability to retain some information active for further use, and to do so in a flexible way allowing information to be prioritized, added, or removed.\" Self- regulatory and goal-maintaining behavior has been tied to working memory so WMT has emerged as a way to alter behavior through improving cognition. For example, Snider et al. sought to extend the time-related reward window in patients with alcohol dependency by improving working memory so they created twelve training exercises including one that had participants move objects on a digital desk while following auditory instructions in a particular order. Attentional bias modification (ABM) seeks to change an individual's behavior by directing their attention away from undesired cues and sometimes includes neutral cues that attention is directed towards. This is commonly carried out by a visual probe test like the one used by Kerst et al. on a handheld mobile device given to habitual cigarette smokers. Participants were asked to engage in three trainings and one assessment per day over a one week period and self report cravings and alterations, if any, in smoking habits. \n",
      "Difference from CBT\n",
      " Although CBTraining employs some similar concepts that define Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, there are some fundamental differences between CBTraining and CBT, both in philosophy and in application. CBTraining is training, not therapy. This is a critical distinction: unlike typical forms and applications of CBT, CBTraining is a process that is finite. In CBT, as with most therapy, the patient plays a large role in determining the direction of the therapy, including the intensity and duration. A CBTraining course, or program, is often broken up into a series of progressive, strategically ordered sessions designed to guide the participant through the process of training the brain away from impulsive thinking. The goal is to adjust the automatic processes that lead to undesired behaviors through repetitious training sessions designed to promote a desired behavior. CBTraining aims to change participants' behaviors through seemingly unrelated tasks by demonstrating near transfer (application of improved skills to circumstances that are very similar to those of the trained task) and far transfer (application of improved skills to circumstances that are very different from those of the trained task). \n",
      "Willpower\n",
      " In addressing addictive behavior and other potentially destructive behavior compelling to the participant, CBTraining uses an approach of urge conditioning/desensitization. This approach stands in contrast to what is commonly most instinctive to people (urge avoidance), and seems counter-intuitive at first. The approach of urge desensitization has been applied to patients with gambling addictions, and research has shown it to be effective. When a person is trying to quit smoking, for instance, the instinct is to remove all smoking paraphernalia from his presence. While this \"out of sight, out of mind\" approach seems to make sense, it does nothing to actually deal with the emotionally driven urge to smoke. A measure of success that is vital for positive results, but not often recorded in studies, is the determination to complete the program and adjust behaviors. Further distinguishing CBTraining from its closely related psychological predecessors is the inclusion of the concept of \"Training\" in place of \"Therapy\". CBTraining is a planned, intricately designed and systematically applied regimen that is purposely finite. CBTraining begins with a specific goal, and is constructed as a time-specific road map to achieving the goal. \n",
      "History of development\n",
      " Along with CBT, CBTraining also owes some debt to Albert Ellis's rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), formerly known as Rational Emotive Therapy. REBT is classified as a form of CBT, and is anchored by the belief that a person is \"affected emotionally by his/her perspective and attitude about outside things.\" As with CBTraining, REBT incorporates Positive Self- Image Psychology. Lou Ryan, a pioneer in the creation, development, and practical application of CBTraining, worked for some time under the guidance of Albert Ellis. In the early 1980s, Ryan, who was well-versed in Ellis's theories and philosophies, met Ellis in Hawaii after a series of seminars. Ellis recognized his own impact in Ryan's CBTraining programs, and played a peripheral part in some of the development. \n",

      " CBTraining has been established to some degree in changing emotionally addictive behaviors related to tobacco. There is evidence that cognitive group behavioral training may be beneficial for patients with type 1 diabetes in their self-care.Diabetes Research Group \"Cognitive Behavioral Group Training for Patients with Type 1 Diabetes\" March 2005 SCBT has been used to help people with diabetes manage their disease, with the primary goal being maintained lifestyle changes to slow or halt the progression of the disease. It has also shown some promise in reducing pain receptor reactions in the brain after a painful stimulus. In studies of overeating and obesity, researchers note that high impulsivity is correlated with overweight and obese individuals. CBTraining in the form of response inhibition training has shown positive results affecting amount and type of food eaten in a sitting and weight reduction, though the longevity of results requires more study. \n",
      "Addiction\n",
      " Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and Substance Use Disorder (SUD) have been correlated to cognitive impairments, though it is not known if one is cause for the other. Verdejo-Garcia et al. specifically indicate AUD and SUD patients display \"deficits in reward and salience valuation, executive functions, and decision-making.\" Continued engagement in treatment programs for these diseases has also been related to cognitive levels leading researchers to aim to promote program engagement through improving cognitive skills in AUD and SUD patients. One study showed improvements in self-control and delayed reward valuation in participants who completed several working memory training sessions, but those gains did not transfer to other inhibition skills. The field of studying CBTraining in AUD and SUD patients suffers from lack of randomized controlled trials making it difficult to quantify results. Nixon and Lewis argue that with studies in this field, it is not sufficient to only show improvements in memory recall and decision-making, but those improvements must be applicable to participants’ lives outside of the study, their continued sobriety and engagement in society. \n",
      " PTSD \n",
      " CBTraining has been applied to symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder in one study by showing participants traumatizing video clips and then having them play a game of Tetris for a specific amount of time. The study was designed to replace the act of recalling a traumatic memory, which is a visuospatial memory process, with another visuospatial activity within the desired time window in order to disrupt the brain's ability to solidify the original memory. Minimal results were reported. \n",

In other words, CBTraining is most effective when applied to people with a high motivation and capacity to change. \n",

      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Crater counting\n",
      "thumb|Shield volcano in Tharsis region on Mars with marked borders, circles represent impact craters counted by crater counting method. Crater counting is a method for estimating the age of a planet's surface based upon the assumptions that when a piece of planetary surface is new, then it has no impact craters; impact craters accumulate after that at a rate that is assumed known. Consequently, counting how many craters of various sizes there are in a given area allows determining how long they have accumulated and, consequently, how long ago the surface has formed. The method has been calibrated using the ages obtained by radiometric dating of samples returned from the Moon by the Luna and Apollo missions. It has been used to estimate the age of areas on Mars and other planets that were covered by lava flows, on the Moon of areas covered by giant mares, and how long ago areas on the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn flooded with new ice. \n",
      "Crater counting and secondary craters\n",
      " The crater counting method requires the presence of independent craters. Independent craters represent the primary impact point on a planets surface, while secondary craters represent the second impact on the surface of a planet. Secondary craters ('secondaries') are craters formed by material excavated by a primary impact that falls back to the surface seconds or minutes later. A way to distinguish primary and secondary craters is to consider their geometric arrangement; for example, large craters often have rays of secondary craters. Secondaries can sometimes also be recognized by their particular shape different from primary craters; this is due to the fact that the excavated material is slower and impacts at a lower angle than asteroids that arrive from space to create the primary crater. The accuracy of age estimates of geologically young surfaces based on crater counting on Mars has been questioned due to formation of large amounts of secondary craters. In one case, the impact that created Zunil crater produced about a hundred secondary craters, some more than 1000 km from the primary impact. If similar impacts also produced comparable amounts of secondaries, it would mean a particular crater-free area of Mars had not been \"splattered by a large, infrequent primary crater\", as opposed to suffering relatively few small primary impacts since its formation. High speed ejecta generated from independent craters generates secondary craters which can resemble independent craters as well, contaminating counting processes as the secondary craters appear more circular and less cluttered than typical secondaries. Secondaries will inevitably contaminate independent crater counts leading to some who may question its effectiveness (see criticism heading for further information). \n",
      " History \n",
      " The earliest scientist to study and produce a paper using crater counting as an age indicator was Ernst Öpik, an Estonian astronomer and astrophysicist. Ernst Öpik utilized the crater counting method to date the Moon's Mare Imbrium to be approximately 4.5 billion years of age, which was corroborated by isotopic samples. The method was also utilized by Gene Shoemaker and Robert Baldwin, and further improved by Bill Hartman. Hartman's work includes dating the Lunar Mare to be approximately 3.6 billion years old, an age that was in accordance with isotopic samples. In later years, Gerhard Neukum advanced the method by proposing a stable impacting population over the period of 4 billion years due to unchanged shape of crater size-frequency distribution. More recent work has seen the transition from Lunar surface to Martian surface cratering, including work done by Neukum and Hartman. Within the past ten years, the Buffered Crater Counting approach has been used to date geologic formations. The calibration provided by the Lunar samples brought back during the six Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972 has remained invaluable to further refining and advancing the crater counting method to this day, but new work is being done to computerize the crater counting technique using Crater Detection Algorithms which uses high resolution imagery to detect small impact craters. \n",
      " Criticism \n",
      " While crater counting has been refined in past years to be an accurate method of determining surface age of a planet despite a lack of isotopic samples, there is dissension in the planetary scientific community concerning the acceptance of crater counting as a precise and accurate form of geochronology. This method is influenced by assumption that at time zero of a planet, the surface had no craters and the craters which followed time zero are spatially and temporally random. It can only be applied with accuracy to planets which have little to no tectonic activity, since constant resurfacing (like on Earth) would distort the true number of craters over time. Shallow surface mechanism such as aeolian deposition, erosion, and diffusional creep can also alter crater morphology, making the surface appear younger than it truly is. Planets heavily covered by water or dense atmosphere would also impede the accuracy of this method, since observational efforts would be hampered. Planets with dense atmospheres will also cause incoming meteors to burn up due to friction before impacting the surface of the planet. The Earth is bombarded with approximately 100 tons of space dust, sand, and pebble particles every day; however, most of this material burns up in the atmosphere before ever reaching the surface of the planet. This is common for space material that is smaller than 25 meters, burning up due to friction in the atmosphere. While resulting observational values dating the Lunar surface from Hartman and Öpik do illustrate ages that correspond to isotopic data, they are potentially hampered by observational bias and human error. New advances continue to improve upon the original method. \n",

      " Below is a list of studies which utilize or concern crater counting: * Dating very young planetary surfaces from crater statistics: A review of issues and challenges **Using small craters for age analysis and the challenges and limitations associated such as illumination and imagery issues, crater modification (such as resurfacing), and impact rates. * Comparison of different crater counting methods applicated to Parana Valles **Testing the reliability of the crater counting method using Parana Valles and comparing results to other methods using fine scale age determination of small diameter craters.

This tool allows for accurate data collection in areas which might have poor image quality or limited area of measurement. * Crater counting lab exercise **Teaching exercise which allows for age determination of Lunar surface taken from Apollo mission images and extend this practiced method to Mars and Earth. * The Importance of Secondary Cratering to Age Constraints on Planetary Surfaces **Discusses small craters caused by interplanetary debris in comparison to secondary craters formed by ejecta of primary impact.

Subsidence craters are created as the roof of the cavity caused by the explosion collapses. This causes the surface to depress into a sink (which subsidence craters are sometimes called; see sink hole). It is possible for further collapse to occur from the sink into the explosion chamber. When this collapse reaches the surface, and the chamber is exposed atmospherically to the surface, it is referred to as a chimney.

Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. If one measures the diameter of a crater, the original depth can be estimated with various ratios.

The idea has since been applied in areas including climate change, environmental health, public health, systemic inequities. and sustainability. One strategy is to add “friction” to undesirable practices and make them harder to do, while making the desired practices “frictionless” or easy to do. This use of the term 'convergence' harkens from the concept of contraction and convergence (C&C;), taking its core principles of Equity and Survival and applying them beyond the frame of greenhouse gas emissions to the wider sustainability agenda. \n",

      "answer: title: Coherent risk measure\n",
      "In the fields of actuarial science and financial economics there are a number of ways that risk can be defined; to clarify the concept theoreticians have described a number of properties that a risk measure might or might not have. A coherent risk measure is a function that satisfies properties of monotonicity, sub-additivity, homogeneity, and translational invariance. \n",
      "Properties\n",
      " Consider a random outcome X viewed as an element of a linear space \\mathcal{L} of measurable functions, defined on an appropriate probability space. A functional \\varrho : \\mathcal{L} → \\R \\cup \\\\{+\\infty\\\\} is said to be coherent risk measure for \\mathcal{L} if it satisfies the following properties: \n",
      "Normalized\n",
      " : \\varrho(0) = 0 That is, the risk when holding no assets is zero. \n",
      "Monotonicity\n",
      " : \\mathrm{If}\\; Z_1,Z_2 \\in \\mathcal{L} \\;\\mathrm{and}\\; Z_1 \\leq Z_2 \\; \\mathrm{a.s.} ,\\; \\mathrm{then} \\; \\varrho(Z_1) \\geq \\varrho(Z_2) That is, if portfolio Z_2 always has better values than portfolio Z_1 under almost all scenarios then the risk of Z_2 should be less than the risk of Z_1. E.g. If Z_1 is an in the money call option (or otherwise) on a stock, and Z_2 is also an in the money call option with a lower strike price. In financial risk management, monotonicity implies a portfolio with greater future returns has less risk. \n",
      "Sub-additivity\n",
      " : \\mathrm{If}\\; Z_1,Z_2 \\in \\mathcal{L} ,\\; \\mathrm{then}\\; \\varrho(Z_1 + Z_2) \\leq \\varrho(Z_1) + \\varrho(Z_2) Indeed, the risk of two portfolios together cannot get any worse than adding the two risks separately: this is the diversification principle. In financial risk management, sub-additivity implies diversification is beneficial. The sub-additivity principle is sometimes also seen as problematic. \n",
      "Positive homogeneity\n",
      " : \\mathrm{If}\\; \\alpha \\ge 0 \\; \\mathrm{and} \\; Z \\in \\mathcal{L} ,\\; \\mathrm{then} \\; \\varrho(\\alpha Z) = \\alpha \\varrho(Z) Loosely speaking, if you double your portfolio then you double your risk. In financial risk management, positive homogeneity implies the risk of a position is proportional to its size. \n",
      "Translation invariance\n",
      " If A is a deterministic portfolio with guaranteed return a and Z \\in \\mathcal{L} then : \\varrho(Z + A) = \\varrho(Z) - a The portfolio A is just adding cash a to your portfolio Z. In particular, if a=\\varrho(Z) then \\varrho(Z+A)=0. In financial risk management, translation invariance implies that the addition of a sure amount of capital reduces the risk by the same amount. \n",
      "Convex risk measures\n",
      " The notion of coherence has been subsequently relaxed. Indeed, the notions of Sub-additivity and Positive Homogeneity can be replaced by the notion of convexity: ; Convexity : \\text{If }Z_1,Z_2 \\in \\mathcal{L}\\text{ and }\\lambda \\in [0,1] \\text{ then }\\varrho(\\lambda Z_1 + (1-\\lambda) Z_2) \\leq \\lambda \\varrho(Z_1) + (1-\\lambda) \\varrho(Z_2) \n",

      " \n",
      " Value at risk \n",
      " It is well known that value at risk is not a coherent risk measure as it does not respect the sub-additivity property. An immediate consequence is that value at risk might discourage diversification. Value at risk is, however, coherent, under the assumption of elliptically distributed losses (e.g. normally distributed) when the portfolio value is a linear function of the asset prices. However, in this case the value at risk becomes equivalent to a mean-variance approach where the risk of a portfolio is measured by the variance of the portfolio's return. The Wang transform function (distortion function) for the Value at Risk is g(x)=\\mathbf{1}_{x\\geq 1-\\alpha}. The non- concavity of g proves the non coherence of this risk measure. ;Illustration As a simple example to demonstrate the non-coherence of value-at-risk consider looking at the VaR of a portfolio at 95% confidence over the next year of two default-able zero coupon bonds that mature in 1 years time denominated in our numeraire currency. Assume the following: * The current yield on the two bonds is 0% * The two bonds are from different issuers * Each bond has a 4% probability of defaulting over the next year * The event of default in either bond is independent of the other * Upon default the bonds have a recovery rate of 30% Under these conditions the 95% VaR for holding either of the bonds is 0 since the probability of default is less than 5%. However if we held a portfolio that consisted of 50% of each bond by value then the 95% VaR is 35% (= 0.5*0.7 + 0.5*0) since the probability of at least one of the bonds defaulting is 7.84% (= 1 - 0.96*0.96) which exceeds 5%. This violates the sub- additivity property showing that VaR is not a coherent risk measure. \n",
      "Average value at risk\n",
      " The average value at risk (sometimes called expected shortfall or conditional value-at-risk or AVaR) is a coherent risk measure, even though it is derived from Value at Risk which is not. The domain can be extended for more general Orlitz Hearts from the more typical Lp spaces. \n",

      "original_text: What is CP violation in particle physics?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: CP violation\n",
      "In particle physics, CP violation is a violation of CP-symmetry (or charge conjugation parity symmetry): the combination of C-symmetry (charge symmetry) and P-symmetry (parity symmetry). CP-symmetry states that the laws of physics should be the same if a particle is interchanged with its antiparticle (C-symmetry) while its spatial coordinates are inverted (\"mirror\" or P-symmetry). The discovery of CP violation in 1964 in the decays of neutral kaons resulted in the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1980 for its discoverers James Cronin and Val Fitch. It plays an important role both in the attempts of cosmology to explain the dominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe, and in the study of weak interactions in particle physics. \n",
      "Overview\n",
      " Until the 1950s, parity conservation was believed to be one of the fundamental geometric conservation laws (along with conservation of energy and conservation of momentum). After the discovery of parity violation in 1956, CP-symmetry was proposed to restore order. However, while the strong interaction and electromagnetic interaction seem to be invariant under the combined CP transformation operation, further experiments showed that this symmetry is slightly violated during certain types of weak decay. Only a weaker version of the symmetry could be preserved by physical phenomena, which was CPT symmetry. Besides C and P, there is a third operation, time reversal T, which corresponds to reversal of motion. Invariance under time reversal implies that whenever a motion is allowed by the laws of physics, the reversed motion is also an allowed one and occurs at the same rate forwards and backwards. The combination of CPT is thought to constitute an exact symmetry of all types of fundamental interactions. Because of the long-held CPT symmetry theorem, provided that it is valid, a violation of the CP-symmetry is equivalent to a violation of the T-symmetry. In this theorem, regarded as one of the basic principles of quantum field theory, charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal are applied together. Direct observation of the time reversal symmetry violation without any assumption of CPT theorem was done in 1998 by two groups, CPLEAR and KTeV collaborations, at CERN and Fermilab, respectively. Already in 1970 Klaus Schubert observed T violation independent of assuming CPT symmetry by using the Bell–Steinberger unitarity relation. \n",
      "History\n",
      " \n",
      "P-symmetry\n",
      " The idea behind parity symmetry was that the equations of particle physics are invariant under mirror inversion. This led to the prediction that the mirror image of a reaction (such as a chemical reaction or radioactive decay) occurs at the same rate as the original reaction. However, in 1956 a careful critical review of the existing experimental data by theoretical physicists Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang revealed that while parity conservation had been verified in decays by the strong or electromagnetic interactions, it was untested in the weak interaction. They proposed several possible direct experimental tests. The first test based on beta decay of cobalt-60 nuclei was carried out in 1956 by a group led by Chien-Shiung Wu, and demonstrated conclusively that weak interactions violate the P-symmetry or, as the analogy goes, some reactions did not occur as often as their mirror image. However, parity symmetry still appears to be valid for all reactions involving electromagnetism and strong interactions. \n",
      "CP-symmetry\n",
      " Overall, the symmetry of a quantum mechanical system can be restored if another approximate symmetry S can be found such that the combined symmetry PS remains unbroken. This rather subtle point about the structure of Hilbert space was realized shortly after the discovery of P violation, and it was proposed that charge conjugation, C, which transforms a particle into its antiparticle, was the suitable symmetry to restore order. In 1956 Reinhard Oehme in a letter to Chen-Ning Yang and shortly after, B. L. Ioffe, Lev Okun and A. P. Rudik showed that the parity violation meant that charge conjugation invariance must also be violated in weak decays. Charge violation was confirmed in the Wu experiment and in experiments performed by Valentine Telegdi and Jerome Friedman and Garwin and Lederman who observed parity non-conservation in pion and muon decay and found that C is also violated. Charge violation was more explicitly shown in experiments done by John Riley Holt at the University of Liverpool. Oehme then wrote a paper with Lee and Yang in which they discussed the interplay of non-invariance under P, C and T. The same result was also independently obtained by Ioffe, Okun and Rudik. Both groups also discussed possible CP violations in neutral kaon decays. Lev Landau proposed in 1957 CP-symmetry, often called just CP as the true symmetry between matter and antimatter. CP-symmetry is the product of two transformations: C for charge conjugation and P for parity. In other words, a process in which all particles are exchanged with their antiparticles was assumed to be equivalent to the mirror image of the original process and so the combined CP-symmetry would be conserved in the weak interaction. In 1962, a group of experimentalists at Dubna, on Okun's insistence, unsuccessfully searched for CP-violating kaon decay. \n",

      "Indirect CP violation\n",
      " In 1964, James Cronin, Val Fitch and coworkers provided clear evidence from kaon decay that CP-symmetry could be broken.The Fitch-Cronin Experiment This work won them the 1980 Nobel Prize. This discovery showed that weak interactions violate not only the charge-conjugation symmetry C between particles and antiparticles and the P or parity, but also their combination. The discovery shocked particle physics and opened the door to questions still at the core of particle physics and of cosmology today. The lack of an exact CP-symmetry, but also the fact that it is so close to a symmetry, introduced a great puzzle. The kind of CP violation discovered in 1964 was linked to the fact that neutral kaons can transform into their antiparticles (in which each quark is replaced with the other's antiquark) and vice versa, but such transformation does not occur with exactly the same probability in both directions; this is called indirect CP violation. \n",
      "Direct CP violation\n",
      " thumb|right|Kaon oscillation box diagram Despite many searches, no other manifestation of CP violation was discovered until the 1990s, when the NA31 experiment at CERN suggested evidence for CP violation in the decay process of the very same neutral kaons (direct CP violation). The observation was somewhat controversial, and final proof for it came in 1999 from the KTeV experiment at Fermilab and the NA48 experiment at CERN. Starting in 2001, a new generation of experiments, including the BaBar experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and the Belle Experiment at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organisation (KEK) in Japan, observed direct CP violation in a different system, namely in decays of the B mesons. A large number of CP violation processes in B meson decays have now been discovered. Before these \"B-factory\" experiments, there was a logical possibility that all CP violation was confined to kaon physics. However, this raised the question of why CP violation did not extend to the strong force, and furthermore, why this was not predicted by the unextended Standard Model, despite the model's accuracy for \"normal\" phenomena. In 2011, a hint of CP violation in decays of neutral D mesons was reported by the LHCb experiment at CERN using 0.6 fb−1 of Run 1 data. However, the same measurement using the full 3.0 fb−1 Run 1 sample was consistent with CP-symmetry. In 2013 LHCb announced discovery of CP violation in strange B meson decays. In March 2019, LHCb announced discovery of CP violation in charmed D^{0} decays with a deviation from zero of 5.3 standard deviations. In 2020, the T2K Collaboration reported some indications of CP violation in leptons for the first time. In this experiment, beams of muon neutrinos () and muon antineutrinos () were alternately produced by an accelerator. By the time they got to the detector, a significantly higher proportion of electron neutrinos () were detected from the beams, than electron antineutrinos () were from the beams. The results were not yet precise enough to determine the size of the CP violation, relative to that seen in quarks. In addition, another similar experiment, NOvA sees no evidence of CP violation in neutrino oscillations and is in slight tension with T2K. \n",
      "CP violation in the Standard Model\n",
      " \"Direct\" CP violation is allowed in the Standard Model if a complex phase appears in the CKM matrix describing quark mixing, or the PMNS matrix describing neutrino mixing. A necessary condition for the appearance of the complex phase is the presence of at least three generations of fermions. If fewer generations are present, the complex phase parameter can be absorbed into redefinitions of the fermion fields. A popular rephasing invariant whose vanishing signals absence of CP violation and occurs in most CP violating amplitudes is the Jarlskog invariant: \\ J = c_{12}\\ c_{13}^2\\ c_{23}\\ s_{12}\\ s_{13}\\ s_{23}\\ \\sin \\delta\\ \\approx\\ 0.00003 \\ , for quarks, which is \\ 0.0003\\ times the maximum value of \\ J_{\\max} = \\tfrac{1}{6} \\sqrt{ 3\\ }\\ \\approx\\ 0.1\\ . For leptons, only an upper limit exists: \\ |J| < 0.03\\ . The reason why such a complex phase causes CP violation is not immediately obvious, but can be seen as follows. Consider any given particles (or sets of particles) \\ a\\ and \\ b\\ , and their antiparticles \\ \\bar{a}\\ and \\ \\bar{b}\\ . Now consider the processes \\ a \\rightarrow b\\ and the corresponding antiparticle process \\ \\bar{a} \\rightarrow \\bar{b}\\ , and denote their amplitudes \\ M\\ and \\ \\bar{M}\\ respectively. Before CP violation, these terms must be the same complex number. We can separate the magnitude and phase by writing \\ M = |M|\\ e^{i\\theta}\\ . If a phase term is introduced from (e.g.) the CKM matrix, denote it \\ e^{i\\phi}\\ . Note that \\ \\bar{M}\\ contains the conjugate matrix to \\ M\\ , so it picks up a phase term \\ e^{-i\\phi}\\ . Now the formula becomes: \\begin{align} M &= |M|\\ e^{i\\theta}\\ e^{+i\\phi} \\\\\\ \\bar{M} &= |M|\\ e^{i\\theta}\\ e^{-i\\phi} \\end{align} Physically measurable reaction rates are proportional to \\ |M|^{2}\\ , thus so far nothing is different. However, consider that there are two different routes: \\ a \\overset{1}{\\longrightarrow} b\\ and \\ a \\overset{2}{\\longrightarrow} b\\ or equivalently, two unrelated intermediate states: \\ a \\rightarrow 1\\rightarrow b\\ and \\ a \\rightarrow 2\\rightarrow b\\ . Now we have: \\begin{alignat}{3} M &= |M_{1}|\\ e^{i\\theta_{1}}\\ e^{i\\phi_{1}} &&\\+ |M_{2}|\\ e^{i\\theta_{2}}\\ e^{i\\phi_{2}} \\\\\\ \\bar{M} &= |M_{1}|\\ e^{i\\theta_{1}}\\ e^{-i\\phi_{1}} &&\\+ |M_{2}|\\ e^{i\\theta_{2}}\\ e^{-i\\phi_{2}}\\ . \\end{alignat} Some further calculation gives: |M|^{2} - |\\bar{M}|^{2} = -4\\ |M_{1}|\\ |M_{2}|\\ \\sin(\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2})\\ \\sin(\\phi_{1} - \\phi_{2})\\ . Thus, we see that a complex phase gives rise to processes that proceed at different rates for particles and antiparticles, and CP is violated. From the theoretical end, the CKM matrix is defined as \\ \\mathrm{V}_\\mathsf{CKM} = \\mathrm{U}_\\mathsf{u}\\ \\mathrm{U}_\\mathsf{d}^\\dagger\\ , where \\ \\mathrm{U}_\\mathsf{u}\\ and \\ \\mathrm{U}_\\mathsf{d}\\ are unitary transformation matrices which diagonalize the fermion mass matrices \\ M_\\mathsf{u}\\ and \\ M_\\mathsf{d}\\ , respectively. Thus, there are two necessary conditions for getting a complex CKM matrix: # At least one of U_u and U_d is complex, or the CKM matrix will be purely real. # If both of them are complex, U_u and U_d must be different, i.e., U_u eq U_d, or the CKM matrix will be an identity matrix, which is also purely real. For a standard model with three fermion generations, the most general non- Hermitian pattern of its mass matrices can be given by M= \\begin{bmatrix} A_1 +i D_1 & B_1 +i C_1 & B_2+i C_2 \\\\\\ B_4+i C_4 & A_2+i D_2 & B_3+i C_3 \\\\\\ B_5+i C_5 & B_6+i C_6 & A_3+i D_6 \\end{bmatrix}. This M matrix contains 9 elements and 18 parameters, 9 from the real coefficients and 9 from the imaginary coefficients. Obviously, a 3x3 matrix with 18 parameters is too difficult to be diagonalize analytically. However, a naturally Hermitian \\mathbf{M^2} = M \\cdot M^+ can be given by \\mathbf{M^2}= \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{A_1} & \\mathbf{B_1}+ i \\mathbf{C_1} & \\mathbf{B_2} + i \\mathbf{C_2} \\\\\\ \\mathbf{B_1}- i \\mathbf{C_1} & \\mathbf{A_2} & \\mathbf{B_3}+ i \\mathbf{C_3} \\\\\\ \\mathbf{B_2}- i \\mathbf{C_2}& \\mathbf{B_3}- i \\mathbf{C_3}& \\mathbf{A_3} \\end{bmatrix}, and it has the same unitary transformation matrix U with M. Besides, parameters in \\mathbf{M^2} are correlated to those in M directly in the ways shown below \\mathbf{ A_1} = A_1^2 + D_1^2 + B_1^2 + C_1^2 + B_2^2 + C_2^2, \\mathbf{ A_2} = A_2^2 + D_2^2 + B_3^2 + C_3^2 + B_4^2 + C_4^2, \\mathbf{ A_3} = A_3^2 + D_3^2 + B_5^2 + C_5^2 + B_6^2 + C_6^2, \\mathbf{ B_1} = A_1 B_4 + D_1 C_4 + B_1 A_2 + C_1 D_2 + B_2 B_3 +C_2 C_3, \\mathbf{ B_2} = A_1 B_5 + D_1 C_5 + B_1 B_6 + C_1 C_6 + B_2 A_3 +C_2 D_3, \\mathbf{ B_3} = B_4 B_5 + C_4 C_5 + B_6 A_2 + C_6 D_2 + A_3 B_3 +D_3 C_3, \\mathbf{ C_1} = D_1 B_4 -A_1 C_4 +A_2 C_1 -B_1 D_2 +B_3 C_2 -B_2 C_3, \\mathbf{ C_2} = D_1 B_5 -A_1 C_5 +B_6 C_1 -B_1 C_6 +A_3 C_2 -B_2 D_3, \\mathbf{ C_3} = C_4 B_5 -B_4 C_5 +D_2 B_6 -A_2 C_6 +A_3 C_3 -B_3 D_3. That means if we diagonalize an \\mathbf{M^2} matrix with 9 parameters, it has the same effect as diagonalizing an M matrix with 18 parameters. Therefore, diagonalizing the \\mathbf{M^2} matrix is certainly the most reasonable choice. The M and \\mathbf{M^2} matrix patterns given above are the most general ones. The perfect way to solve the CPV problem in the standard model is to diagonalize such matrices analytically and to achieve a U matrix which applies to both. Unfortunately, even the \\mathbf{M^2} matrix has only 9 parameters, it is still too complicated to be diagonalized directly. Thus, an assumption \\mathbf{M_R^2}} \\cdot \\mathbf{M_I^{2+}} - \\mathbf{M_I^2} \\cdot \\mathbf{M_R^{2+} =0 was employed to simplify the pattern, where \\mathbf{ M^2_R} is the real part of \\mathbf{M^2} and \\mathbf{M^2_I} is the imaginary part. Such an assumption could further reduce the parameter number from 9 to 5 and the reduced \\mathbf{M^2} matrix can be given by \\mathbf {M^2} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{ A} + \\mathbf{B (x y- {x \\over y})} & \\mathbf{ y B} &\\mathbf{ x B} \\\\\\\\\\mathbf{y B} & \\mathbf{A +B ({y \\over x}-{x \\over y})} & \\mathbf{ B} \\\\\\ \\mathbf{ x B} & \\mathbf{ B} & \\mathbf{ A} \\end{bmatrix} \\+ i \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\mathbf{ C \\over y} & \\- \\mathbf{C \\over x} \\\\\\ - \\mathbf{ C \\over y} & 0 & \\mathbf{ C} \\\\\\ i \\mathbf{C \\over x} & \\- \\mathbf{C} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\mathbf{ M^2_R}+ i \\mathbf{ M^2_I}, where \\mathbf{A \\equiv A_3}, \\mathbf{ B \\equiv B_3}, \\mathbf{ C \\equiv C_3}, \\mathbf{x \\equiv B_2 / B_3}, and \\mathbf{ y \\equiv B_1 / B_3} . Diagonalizing \\mathbf{M^2} analytically, the eigenvalues are given by \\mathbf{m^2_1} = \\mathbf{ A-B {x \\over y} -C {\\sqrt {\\mathbf{ x^2 +y^2 +x^2 y^2} \\over {x y}}}}, \\mathbf{ m^2_2} = \\mathbf{A-B{x \\over y} + C{\\sqrt \\mathbf{ x^2 +y^2 +x^2 y^2} \\over {x y}}}, \\mathbf{ m^2_3} = \\mathbf{ A+B{{(x^2+1) y} \\over x}}, and the U matrix for up-type quarks can then be given by \\mathbf{U^u} = \\begin{bmatrix} {-\\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2}} \\over \\sqrt{\\mathbf{2(x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2)}}} & {\\mathbf{{x(y^2-i \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}})}} \\over {\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2}} \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}}} } & {\\mathbf{{y(x^2+i \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}})}} \\over {\\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2}} \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}}}} \\\\\\ {-\\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2}} \\over \\sqrt{ \\mathbf{2(x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2)}}} & {\\mathbf{x(y^2+i \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}})} \\over {\\sqrt{ 2} \\sqrt{ \\mathbf{ x^2+y^2} \\sqrt{ \\mathbf{ x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}}}}} & {\\mathbf{y(x^2-i \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2})} \\over {\\sqrt{\\bf 2} \\sqrt{\\bf x^2+y^2} \\sqrt{\\bf x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}}}} \\\\\\ {\\mathbf{x y} \\over \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}}} & {\\mathbf{y \\over \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}}} } & {\\mathbf{x \\over \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x^2+y^2+x^2 y^2}}}} \\end{bmatrix}. However, the eigenvalues' order does not necessarily have to be (\\mathbf{ m^2_1} , \\mathbf{ m^2_2} , \\mathbf{ m^2_3} ) ; they can also be any permutation of them. After obtaining a general U matrix pattern, it can also be applied to down-type quarks by introducing primed parameters. To construct the CKM matrix, the U matrix for up-type quarks, denoted as U^u , can be multiplied with the conjugate transpose of the U matrix for down-type quarks, denoted as U^{d+} . As mentioned earlier, there are no inherent constraints that dictate the assignment of eigenvalues to specific quark flavors. Consequently, all 36 potential permutations of eigenvalues are listed in the provided reference . Among these 36 potential CKM matrices, 4 of them V[52]= V \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ 3 \\\\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = V[52]^*=V^* \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\\\ 3 \\\\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} s & p^* & r^* \\\\\\ p^{\\prime *} & q & p^{\\prime} \\\\\\ r & p & s^* \\end{bmatrix} and V[22]= V \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\\\ 3 \\\\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = V^*[55]=V^*\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\ 3 \\\\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} r & p & s^* \\\\\\ p^{\\prime *} & q & p^{\\prime} \\\\\\ s & p^* & r^* \\end{bmatrix}, fit experimental data to the order of \\lambda^{1/2} or better, at tree level, where \\lambda is one of the Wolfenstein parameters.

Since the discovery of CP violation in 1964, physicists have believed that in theory, within the framework of the Standard Model, it is sufficient to search for appropriate Yukawa couplings (equivalent to a mass matrix) in order to generate a complex phase in the CKM matrix, thus automatically breaking CP symmetry. However, the specific matrix pattern has remained elusive. The above derivation provides the first evidence for this idea and offers some explicit examples to support it. \n",
      "Strong CP problem\n",
      " There is no experimentally known violation of the CP-symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. As there is no known reason for it to be conserved in QCD specifically, this is a \"fine tuning\" problem known as the strong CP problem. QCD does not violate the CP-symmetry as easily as the electroweak theory; unlike the electroweak theory in which the gauge fields couple to chiral currents constructed from the fermionic fields, the gluons couple to vector currents. Experiments do not indicate any CP violation in the QCD sector. For example, a generic CP violation in the strongly interacting sector would create the electric dipole moment of the neutron which would be comparable to 10−18 e·m while the experimental upper bound is roughly one trillionth that size. This is a problem because at the end, there are natural terms in the QCD Lagrangian that are able to break the CP-symmetry. {\\mathcal L} = -\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu u} F^{\\mu u} - \\frac{n_f g^2\\theta}{32\\pi^2} F_{\\mu u} \\tilde F^{\\mu u} + \\bar \\psi\\left(i\\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m e^{i\\theta'\\gamma_5}\\right) \\psi For a nonzero choice of the θ angle and the chiral phase of the quark mass θ′ one expects the CP-symmetry to be violated. One usually assumes that the chiral quark mass phase can be converted to a contribution to the total effective \\scriptstyle{\\tilde\\theta} angle, but it remains to be explained why this angle is extremely small instead of being of order one; the particular value of the θ angle that must be very close to zero (in this case) is an example of a fine-tuning problem in physics, and is typically solved by physics beyond the Standard Model. There are several proposed solutions to solve the strong CP problem. The most well-known is Peccei–Quinn theory, involving new scalar particles called axions. A newer, more radical approach not requiring the axion is a theory involving two time dimensions first proposed in 1998 by Bars, Deliduman, and Andreev. \n",
      "Matter–antimatter imbalance\n",
      " The non-dark matter universe is made chiefly of matter, rather than consisting of equal parts of matter and antimatter as might be expected. It can be demonstrated that, to create an imbalance in matter and antimatter from an initial condition of balance, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied, one of which is the existence of CP violation during the extreme conditions of the first seconds after the Big Bang. Explanations which do not involve CP violation are less plausible, since they rely on the assumption that the matter–antimatter imbalance was present at the beginning, or on other admittedly exotic assumptions. The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter if CP-symmetry was preserved; as such, there should have been total cancellation of both—protons should have cancelled with antiprotons, electrons with positrons, neutrons with antineutrons, and so on. This would have resulted in a sea of radiation in the universe with no matter. Since this is not the case, after the Big Bang, physical laws must have acted differently for matter and antimatter, i.e. violating CP-symmetry. The Standard Model contains at least three sources of CP violation. The first of these, involving the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix in the quark sector, has been observed experimentally and can only account for a small portion of the CP violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry. The strong interaction should also violate CP, in principle, but the failure to observe the electric dipole moment of the neutron in experiments suggests that any CP violation in the strong sector is also too small to account for the necessary CP violation in the early universe. The third source of CP violation is the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix in the lepton sector. The current long- baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, T2K and NOνA, may be able to find evidence of CP violation over a small fraction of possible values of the CP violating Dirac phase while the proposed next-generation experiments, Hyper- Kamiokande and DUNE, will be sensitive enough to definitively observe CP violation over a relatively large fraction of possible values of the Dirac phase. Further into the future, a neutrino factory could be sensitive to nearly all possible values of the CP violating Dirac phase. If neutrinos are Majorana fermions, the PMNS matrix could have two additional CP violating Majorana phases, leading to a fourth source of CP violation within the Standard Model. The experimental evidence for Majorana neutrinos would be the observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay. The best limits come from the GERDA experiment. CP violation in the lepton sector generates a matter- antimatter asymmetry through a process called leptogenesis. This could become the preferred explanation in the Standard Model for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe if CP violation is experimentally confirmed in the lepton sector. If CP violation in the lepton sector is experimentally determined to be too small to account for matter-antimatter asymmetry, some new physics beyond the Standard Model would be required to explain additional sources of CP violation. Adding new particles and/or interactions to the Standard Model generally introduces new sources of CP violation since CP is not a symmetry of nature. Sakharov proposed a way to restore CP-symmetry using T-symmetry, extending spacetime before the Big Bang. He described complete CPT reflections of events on each side of what he called the \"initial singularity\". Because of this, phenomena with an opposite arrow of time at t < 0 would undergo an opposite CP violation, so the CP-symmetry would be preserved as a whole. The anomalous excess of matter over antimatter after the Big Bang in the orthochronous (or positive) sector, becomes an excess of antimatter before the Big Bang (antichronous or negative sector) as both charge conjugation, parity and arrow of time are reversed due to CPT reflections of all phenomena occurring over the initial singularity: \n",

Harvie Professor of Social Thought and Comparative Ethics in the Philosophy and Psychology Departments at the University of Pennsylvania, professor of Legal Studies in the Wharton School, and director of the Master in Behavioral Decision Sciences program (https://www.lps.upenn.edu/degree- programs/mbds) and the Philosophy, Politics and Economics program. She has worked on problems in the philosophy of social science, rational choice and game theory. More recently, her work has focused on the nature and evolution of social norms, and the design of behavioral experiments to test under which conditions norms will be followed. She is a leader in the field of behavioral ethics and is the director of the Center for Social Norms and Behavioral Dynamics at the University of Pennsylvania. \n",

      " Bicchieri was born in Milan, Italy. She received her laurea in philosophy, summa cum laude, from the University of Milan in 1976, and her PhD in philosophy of science at Cambridge University in 1984. Before moving to the University of Pennsylvania, she taught in the program of Philosophy and Economics at Barnard College, Columbia University, in the Philosophy department at Notre Dame University and in the departments of Philosophy and Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. She is also a member of the advisory board at the School of Government at LUISS University of Rome, where she occasionally teaches. Bicchieri has served as a consultant to UNICEF since 2008, and she has advised various NGOs and other international organizations on social norms and how to deal with them when combating negative social practices. Her work on social norms has been adopted by UNICEF in its campaigns to eliminate practices that violate human rights. She was knighted Cavaliere Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana in 2007. In 2020 she was elected to the Germany National Academy of Science, Leopoldina. In 2021, she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is a Honorary Fellow of Wolfson College at Cambridge University. \n",
      "Philosophical work\n",
      " Bicchieri is especially known for her work regarding the epistemic foundations of game theory and social norms. Her recent experimental work is a major contribution to behavioral ethics, as it shows how different kind of expectations influence pro-social behavior. The Behavioral Ethics Lab which she leads specializes in the study of social norms, moral heuristics, biases, resource division, cheating, corruption, measures of autonomy and their relation to social change. \n",
      "Social norms\n",
      " Bicchieri has developed a new theory of social norms that challenges several of the fundamental methodological assumptions of the social sciences. She argues that the emphasis social scientists place upon rational deliberation obscures the fact that many successful choices occur even though the individuals make their choices without much deliberation. She explores in depth the more automatic components of coordination and proposes a heuristic account of coordination that complements the more traditional deliberational account.C. Bicchieri,The Grammar of Society: The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms (Cambridge University Press, 2006) According to her heuristic account, individuals conform with a social norm as an automatic response to cues in their situation that focus their attention on this particular norm. A social norm is analyzed as a rule for choosing in a mixed- motive game, such as the prisoner's dilemma, that members of a population prefer to follow on condition that they expect sufficiently many in the population to follow the rule. Bicchieri applies this account of social norms and heuristic selection of norms to a number of important problems in the social sciences, including bargaining, the prisoners' dilemma and suboptimal norms based upon pluralistic ignorance. Her most recent research is experimental, showing how normative and empirical expectations support norm compliance, and how manipulating such expectations can radically change behavior. Her experimental results show that most subjects have a conditional preference for following pro-social norms. Manipulating their expectations causes major behavioral changes (i.e., from fair to unfair choices, from cooperation to defection). She asserts that there are no such things as stable dispositions or unconditional preferences (to be fair, reciprocate, cooperate, and so on). She similarly concludes that policymakers who want to induce pro- social behavior have to work on changing people's expectations about how others behave and how others think one should behave in similar situations (i.e. people's empirical and normative expectations). These results have major consequences for our understanding of moral behavior and the construction of better normative theories, grounded on what people can in fact do.C. Bicchieri and A. Chavez (2010), Behaving as Expected: Public Information and Fairness Norms, Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, 23(2): 161-178. \n",
      "Epistemic foundations of game theory\n",
      " Bicchieri pioneered work on counterfactuals and belief-revision in games, and the consequences of relaxing the common knowledge assumption. Her contributions include axiomatic models of players' theory of the game and the proof that—in a large class of games—a player's theory of the game is consistent only if the player's knowledge is limited.C. Bicchieri, Rationality and Coordination (Cambridge University Press 2003). An important consequence of assuming bounded knowledge is that it allows for more intuitive solutions to familiar games such as the finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma or the chain-store paradox. Bicchieri has also devised mechanical procedures (algorithms) that allow players to compute solutions for games of perfect and imperfect information. Devising such procedures is particularly important for Artificial Intelligence applications, since interacting software agents have to be programmed to play a variety of 'games'.C. Bicchieri and A.

In particle physics, CP stands for the combination of charge conjugation symmetry (C) and parity symmetry (P). According to the current mathematical formulation of quantum chromodynamics, a violation of CP-symmetry in strong interactions could occur. However, no violation of the CP-symmetry has ever been seen in any experiment involving only the strong interaction. As there is no known reason in QCD for it to necessarily be conserved, this is a \"fine tuning\" problem known as the strong CP problem. The strong CP problem is sometimes regarded as an unsolved problem in physics, and has been referred to as \"the most underrated puzzle in all of physics.\" There are several proposed solutions to solve the strong CP problem.

This model has long since been ruled out by experiments and has instead been replaced by similar invisible axion models which utilize the same mechanism to solve the strong CP problem. ==Overview== Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has a complicated vacuum structure which gives rise to a CP violating θ-term in the Lagrangian.

      "answer: title: Character mask\n",
      "In Marxist philosophy, a character mask () is a prescribed social role which conceals the contradictions of a social relation or order. The term was used by Karl Marx in published writings from the 1840s to the 1860s, and also by Friedrich Engels. It is related to the classical Greek concepts of mimesis (imitative representation using analogies) and prosopopoeia (impersonation or personification), and the Roman concept of persona,A famous anthropological essay on the idea of the \"persona\" is Marcel Mauss, \"A category of the human mind: the notion of person, the notion of 'self'.\" in: Mauss, Sociology and psychology: essays. Translated by Ben Brewster. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979. See, for a recent discussion of the concept of persona: Marta Cecilia Betancur García (Universidad de Caldas), \"Persona y máscara\", Praxis Filosófica, Nueva serie, no. 30, January–June 2010: pp. 7–16. Praxi.univalle.edu.co but also differs from them.The Greek concept of prosopon, meaning \"the face\", literally is \"that which is set before the eyes\", and thus also refers to \"a mask\" (John Mack (ed.), Masks: the art of expression. London: British Museum, 1994, p. 151). In Greek theatre, the function of the mask was impersonate a character. In post-Freudian psychology, by contrast, the mask is a metaphor for the external self, concealing the reality within (ibid., p. 151-152, 157). Neo-Marxist and non-Marxist sociologists,The neo-Marxists referring to character masks were especially those of the Frankfurt School, such as Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer. For a non-Marxist approach to character masks, see Anthony Giddens, The constitution of society: outline of the theory of structuration. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986. philosophersSee: Alasdair Macintyre, After Virtue. University of Notre Dame Press, 2007, pp. 27–35, 109–110; Peter Sloterdijk, Critique of Cynical Reason. Verso, 1988, p. 37. and anthropologistsE.g. Lawrence Krader, David Graeber have used character masks to interpret how people relate in societies with a complex division of labour, where people depend on trade to meet many of their needs. Marx's own notion of the character mask was not a fixed idea with a singular definition. \n",
      "Versus social masks\n",
      " As a psychological term, \"character\" is more common in continental Europe, while in Britain and North America the term \"personality\" is used in approximately the same contexts.Gordon W. Allport, \"My encounters with personality theory\". Recorded and edited reminiscence at the Boston University School of Theology, October 12, 1962, transcribed by W. Douglas, p. 1. As cited by Christopher F. Monte and Robert N. Sollod, Beneath the mask. An introduction to theories of personality, 7th edition. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons, 2003, p. 2. A Marxist interpretation of character is provided by Kit R. Christensen, The Politics of Character Development: A Marxist Reappraisal of the Moral Life. Praeger, 1994. Marx however uses the term \"character mask\" analogously to a theatrical role, where the actor (or the characteristics of a prop) represents a certain interest or function, and intends by character both \"the characteristics of somebody\" and \"the characteristics of something\". Marx's metaphorical use of the term \"character masks\" refers to carnival masks and the masks used in classical Greek theatre. The issue is the social form in which a practice is acted out. Sophisticated academic language about the sociology of roles did not exist in the mid-19th century. Thus, Marx borrowed from theatre and literature to express his idea.Edith Hall, The theatrical cast of Athens; interactions between ancient Greek drama & society. Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 31. György Lukács pioneered a sociology of drama in 1909,George Lukács, \"The Sociology of Modern Drama\" (transl. Lee Baxandall), The Tulane Drama Review, 1965, Vol.9(4), pp.146–170. a sociology of roles began only in the 1930s, and a specific sociology of theatre (e.g. by Jean Duvignaud) first emerged in the 1960s.Elizabeth and Tom Burns, Sociology of Literature and Drama. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973. Marx's concept is both that an identity appears differently from its true identity (it is masked or disguised), and that this difference has practical consequences. The mask is not a decoration, but performs a function and has effects, even independently of the mask bearer. The closest equivalent term in modern English is social masks. However, this translation is inappropriate: *A \"social mask\" is a mask of an individual, while Marx's concept of character masks is applied to cases other than individuals, when matters present themselves differently from their true nature.See e.g. Ingo Elbe, \"Thesen zum Begriff der Charaktermaske\" Rote Ruhr Uni site. Marxists and non-Marxists have applied it to persons and politicians,See for example Ronald W. Clark, Lenin: the man behind the mask. New York: St Martins Press, 1989; Gary Allen, Richard Nixon: The Man Behind The Mask. Boston: Western Islands, 1971 (see also Richard Nixon mask; Adam Robinson, Bin Laden: behind the mask of the terrorist. Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2001. Nick Henck, Subcommander Marcos: The Man and the Mask. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2007. groups and social classes, mass media, social movements and political parties, social institutions, organizations and functions, governments, symbolic expressions, historical eras, and dramatic, literary or theatrical contexts. *The category of \"social masks\" is much more general and inclusive, and Marx's character masks are a subtype of social mask. They are masks of people and things which represent a social, political, intellectual or economic function, within given social relationships among groups of people. *Marx's character masks are bound up with a specific type of society at a specific historical time, and with a specific theory of how the social relations in that society function. However, the concept of \"social masks\" assumes no specific theory, society or historical time. Social masks can be assumed to have existed forever, and are treated as a permanent part of human existence. \n",
      "\"False awareness\"\n",
      " There is a link between character masks and deliberate misrepresentation or hypocrisy.Anne Duncan, Performance and identity in the classical world. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006. But character masks are not always hypocritical, as the motive for their use is genuine, principled or naive – or a product of self-delusion. People can mask their behavior, or mask a situation, without being aware that they are doing so.Donald Rumsfeld: \"Reports that say that something has not happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we do not know we do not know.\" – Department of Defense news briefing, February 12, 2002. Rumsfeld leaves out \"the things we do not know that we know\", perhaps \"do not want to know about ourselves\" and therefore mask to ourselves – giving rise to the possibility of being \"unconsciously conscious\" or \"consciously unconscious\", a theme explored by Sigmund Freud and his school. See further: John Keegan, The mask of command. New York : Viking, 1987. Engels's German expression \"falsch Bewusstsein\" is correctly translated as \"false awareness\", not as \"false consciousness\". Paul Ricœur explains: \"False awareness\" (''), as used by Friedrich Engels, does not refer to errors in the content of awareness. It refers to an absence of awareness of what is behind the ideas being worked with, how they originated, or what the real role or effect of the ideas is. The first result of this is that the ideologists believe they are performing certain intellectual operations with regard to an issue, which, in reality, have a different significance than they expect. The second result is that their intellectual creations can then function as a mask for what is really at stake, as they portray the issue in a one-sided or distorted way – without them being aware of how that works. The ideologists are aware and unaware at the same time. The problem, says Engels, is that they exaggerate the power of ideas, to the point where ideas appear to cause everything that happens. This occurs more often if the intellectual productions are quite distant from the practical context, or if they concern specialized, highly abstract ideas which are difficult to verify.Letter of Friedrich Engels to Franz Mehring, 14 July 1893 \n",

      " \n",
      "Historical\n",
      " According to Marx and Engels, character masks of an era are the main symbolic expressions of self-justification or apologia, which disguises, embellishes or obscures social contradictions (\"the bits that do not fit\"). A mystical truth in this context is a cultural idea which cannot be verified, because it is abstract rather than logical. Mystical truths cannot be tested scientifically, only subjectively experienced. \n",
      "Economic\n",
      " Marx argues that, as capitalist class society is intrinsically a contradictory system – it contains many conflicting and competing forces – masking of its true characteristics is an integral feature of how it operates. Buyers and sellers compete with other buyers and sellers. Businesses cannot practically do so without confidentiality and secrecy. Workers compete for job opportunities and access to resources. Capitalists and workers compete for their share of the new wealth that is produced, and nations compete with other nations. The masks are therefore necessary, and the more a person knows about others, the more subtle and sophisticated the masks become. A centerpiece of Marx's critique of political economy is that the labour contract between a worker and their employer obscures the true economic relationship. Marx argues that workers do not sell their labor, but their labor power, creating a profitable difference between what they are paid and the value they create for the employer (a form of economic exploitation). Thus, the foundation of capitalist wealth creation involves a mask.Karl Marx, Value, Price and Profit, part 9.Marxists.org; Karl Marx, Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875), part 2 (emphases added). Marxists.org Cf. the Resultate manuscript in Capital, Volume I, Penguin edition, p. 1064, where Marx uses the word \"vertuscht\" (\"covered up\"). More generally, Marx argues that transactions in the capitalist economy are rarely transparent – they appear different from what they really are. This is discovered only when the total context in which they occur is examined. Hence Marx writes: This implies another level of masking, because the economic character masks are then equated with authentic behaviour. The effect in this case is, that the theories of economics masks how the economy actually works, by describing its surface appearance as its real nature. The general principles of economics may appear to explain it, but in reality they do not. The theory is therefore ultimately arbitrary. Either aspects of the economy are studied in isolation from the context in which they occur, or generalizations are formed which leave essential parts out. These distortions are ideologically useful to justify an economic system, position or policy as reasonable, but it is a hindrance to true understanding.For a commentary by a Marxian economist, see: Duncan K. Foley, The strange history of the economic agent . \n",

      "Masks as mediators of social contradictions\n",
      " Abstractly, the masking processes specific to capitalist society mediate and reconcile social contradictions, which arise from three main sources: * relations of production (ownership relations governing the factors of production, defined by property rights, and work roles), which create and maintain a class-divided society, in which citizens are formally equal under the law but unequal in reality; class interests are represented as the general interest and vice versa.Franz Leopold Neumann, The democratic and the authoritarian state: Essays in political and legal theory. Free Press, 1957, pp. 61–62. The state formally serves \"the general interest\" of society, but in reality it mainly serves the general interest of the ruling class, and more specifically what the elite, the polity or the political class considers to be the general interest of society. * relations of exchange in the marketplace,Marx analyzes the social meaning of exchange relations in the Grundrisse, Penguin ed., pp. 242–245. Evgeny Pashukanis argues that \"The egoistic subject, the subject of a right and the moral personality are the three basic masks under which man appears in commodity production.\" – Pashukanis, Law and Marxism: a general theory. Ink Links, 1978, chapter 6. Marxists.org where buyers and sellers bargain with each other, and with other buyers and sellers, to get the \"best deal\" for themselves, although they have to cooperate to get it (they must give something to receive something). Supposedly this is a \"level playing field\" but in reality it is not, simply because some command vastly greater resources than others. The attempt is made to \"personalize\" otherwise impersonal or anonymous market relationships expressed by transactions. * the combination of relations of production and exchange, in which competitors have an interest in hiding certain information, while presenting themselves outwardly in the most advantageous way. Specifically, people are placed in the position where they both have to compete and to cooperate with each other at the same time, at a very advanced (or at least civilized) level, and to reconcile this predicament involves them in masking.Leo Löwenthal, Literature and the Image of Man. Sociological Studies of the European Drama and Novel, 1600–1900. Boston: Beacon Press, 1957, p. 170. This requirement exists in all kinds of types of society, but in bourgeois society it takes specific forms, reflecting the element of financial gain which is involved in the way people are relating or are related. \n",
      "\"Naked self-interest\"\n",
      " In The Communist Manifesto, Marx & Engels had stated that: This \"naked self-interest\" seems to contradict the idea of \"masking\" in bourgeois society. Supposedly market trade creates transparency and an \"open society\" of free citizens. In reality, Marx and Engels claim, it does not.For a commentary, see: Elmar Altvater & Birgit Mahnkopf, \"The world market unbound.\" In: Review of International Political Economy, Volume 4, Issue 3, September 1997, pp. 448–471. The \"nakedness\" may not reveal very much other than the requirements of trade; it is just that the cultural patterns of what is hidden and what is revealed differ from feudal and ancient society. According to Marx, the labour market appears as the \"very Eden of the innate rights of man\",Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin ed., p. 280. insofar workers can choose to sell their labour-power freely, but in reality, workers are forced to do so, often on terms unfavourable to them, to survive. As soon as they are inside the factory or office, they have to follow orders and submit to the authority of the employer. Even in \"naked commerce\", the possible methods of \"masking\" what one is, what one represents or what one does, are extremely diverse. Human languages and numerical systems, for example, offer very subtle distinctions of meaning that can \"cover up\" something, or present it as different from what it really is. Anthropologists, sociologists and linguists have sometimes studied \"linguistic masking\".See for example Franklin C. Southworth, \"Linguistic masks for power: some relationships between semantic and social change\", Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 16, 1974, pp. 177–19 and R.D.V. Glasgow, Madness, Masks and Laughter: An Essay on Comedy. Cranbury, New Jersey: Associated University Press, 1994. The \"masking\" of quantitative relationships takes three main forms: *masking plain computational error; *masking through a categorization of counting units which hides the real situation, or presents it in a certain light; *masking through the (\"meta-theoretical\") interpretation of the overall significance of a quantitative result. Data may be accepted as a valid result, but dismissed as irrelevant or unimportant in a given context, and therefore not worth paying attention to; or conversely, the importance of specific data may be highlighted as being more important than other related facts. \n",

      " The theatrical mask, expressing an acting role, was supposedly first invented in the West by the Greek actor Thespis of Attica (6th century BC)\"Western Theatre\", article in Encyclopædia Britannica. and the Greek Aristotelian philosopher Theophrastus (circa 371–287 BC) is credited with being the first in the West to define human character in terms of a typology of personal strengths and weaknesses.Wolfgang Fritz Haug, \"Charaktermaske\", in: Wolfgang Fritz Haug (ed.), Historisch-kritisches Wörterbuch des Marxismus, Vol. 2. Hamburg: Das Argument, 1995, p. 438. Haug cites P. Steinmetz, \"Afterword\", in: Theophrast, Charactere. Stuttgart, 1970, and G. Wilpert, Sachwortenbuch der Literatur, Stuttgart 1989. An English text is available online.Eudaemonist.com Indeed, Marx's idea of character masks appears to have originated in his doctoral studies of Greek philosophy in 1837–39. At that time, the theatre was one of the few places in Germany where opinions about public affairs could be fairly freely aired, if only in fictionalized form.Robert C. Tucker, ed., The Marx- Engels Reader. Norton 2nd ed., 1978) Marxists.org. See Wolfgang Fritz Haug, \"Charaktermaske\", p. 442. See also: Christoph Henning, \"Charaktermaske und Individualität bei Marx\", in: Marx-Engels Jahrbuch 2009. Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2010, which discusses various interpretations. The general intellectual milieu in which Marx developed his ideas is covered in: Warren Breckman, Marx, the young Hegelians and the origins of radical social theory: Dethroning the Self . Cambridge University Press, 1999. Independently from Marx, the romantic novelist Jean Paul also used the concept, in portraying the human problems of individuation.Commentary in: Jochen Hörisch, \"Charaktermasken. Subjektivität und Trauma bei Jean Paul und Marx.\" In: Jahrbuch der Jean-Paul-Gesellschaft, Nr. 14, 1979, republished in Jochen Hörisch, Die andere Goethezeit: Poetische Mobilmachung des Subjekts um 1800. München: Fink, 1998. In Jean Paul's aesthetics, the Charaktermaske is the observable face or appearance-form of a hidden self.See Jean Paul, Vorschule der Ästhetik, in Jean Paul, Werke (ed. Nortbert Miller), Volume 5. München: Carl Hanser Verlag, 1963, para. 56, p. 208. It is Jean Paul's definition which is cited in the Deutsches Wörterbuch compiled by Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm from 1838 onward.Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsches Wörterbuch.Woerterbuchnetz.de Woefterbuchnetz.de. Other early literary uses of the German term charaktermaske are found in Joseph von Eichendorff's 1815 novel Ahnung und Gegenwart,Joseph von Eichendorff, Sämtliche Erzählungen, Vol. 1: Ahnung und Gegenwart. Berlin: Deutscher Klassikerverlag, 2007, chapter 11. Cluberzengel.de a veiled attack against Napoleon, and some years later, in writings by Heinrich Heine. Heine was among the first to use the theatrical term \"Charaktermaske\" to describe a social setting.Roger F. Cook, A companion to the works of Heinrich Heine. Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2002, p.63. See e.g. Heinrich Heine, \"Zweiter Brief\" aus Berlin (1822), in: Werke und Briefe in zehn Bänden.

Perhaps the concept was also inspired by Hegel's discussion of masks in his The Phenomenology of Spirit.In the section of the Phenomenology on \"the spiritual work of art\", paragraphs 742–744.Marxists.org In a complex 1844 argument where Marx criticizes Hegel's Phenomenology, the suggestion is that contradictions of object and subject arise because philosophical thought masks important aspects of the issue to itself (see Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, Third Manuscript: \"Private Property and Labour\" Marxists.org. For a commentary on Hegels' masks in the Phenomenology, see e.g. Robert Bernasconi, \"Persons and masks: The phenomenology of the spirit and its laws\", in: Drucilla Cornell et al. (eds.), Hegel and Legal Theory. New York: Routledge, 1991, pp 78–94. In his Aesthetics, Hegel contrasts the fixed, abstract and universal character masks of the Commedia dell'arte with the romantic depiction of \"character\" as a living, subjective individuality embodied in the whole person.G.W.F. Hegel, Aesthetics. Lectures on Fine Art (transl. T.M. Knox), Vol. 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), part 2, chapter 3 \"the romantic form of art\", p. 576-577. In 1841, the German theatre critic Heinrich Theodor Rötscher explicitly defined a \"character mask\" as a theatrical role, acted out in such a way that it expresses all aspects of the assumed personality, his/her social station and background; successfully done, the audience would be able to recognize this personality on first impression.Heinrich Theodor Rötscher, Die Kunst der Dramatischen Darstellung.

Marxists.org Certainly, European writers and thinkers in the 17th and 18th centuries (the era of the Enlightenment) were very preoccupied with human character and characterology, many different typologies being proposed; human character was increasingly being defined in a secular way, independent of virtues and vices defined by religion.See e.g. Mary Alice Budge, The rhetoric of operation: character masks in the fiction of Daniel Defoe.

However, both the official Moscow translation of Capital, Volume I into English, as well as the revised 1976 Penguin translation of Capital, Volume I into English by Ben Fowkes, deleted all reference to character masks, substituting a non-literal translation.The academic interpretation of Marx's text in the English-speaking world was for many years influenced by the anti- humanist Marxist Louis Althusser, who believed human beings are only the bearers (receptacles) of a structured totality of social relations. The translator Ben Fowkes states that \"The concept of an object (or person) as the receptacle, repository, bearer of some thing or tendency quite different from it appears repeatedly in Capital, and I have tried to translate it uniformly as 'bearer'.\" (Capital, Volume I, 1976 Penguin edition, p. 179). See also Perelman, Marx's crises theory: scarcity, labor and finance. New York: Praeger Publishers, 1987, p. 95) English translators of other writings by Marx & Engels, or of classical Marxist texts, quite often deleted Charaktermaske as well, and often substituted other words such as \"mask\", \"role\", \"appearance\", \"puppet\", \"guise\" and \"persona\". Marx's concept of character masks has therefore been little known in the English-speaking world, except through the translated writings of the Frankfurt School and other (mainly German or Austrian) Marxists using the term. Tom Bottomore's sociological dictionary of Marxist thought has no entry for the important concept of character masks.Tom Bottomore et al. (ed.), A dictionary of Marxist Thought, Basil Blackwell 1983 (rev. edition 1991). The Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory likewise does not refer to it.See David Macey, The Penguin Dictionary of Critical Theory. Penguin Books, 2000. The Cambridge Companion to Critical Theory does refer in passing to character masks, with reference to Dialectic of Enlightenment. See Fred Rush (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Critical Theory. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 255. David Harvey, the world-famous New Left popularizer of Marx's writings, does not mention the concept at all in works such as his The Limits to Capital. Likewise Fredric Jameson, the famous commentator on post modernity, offers no analysis of the concept. There is no entry for the concept in James Russell's Marx-Engels Dictionary,James Russell, Marx-Engels Dictionary. Brighton: Harvester 1980. in Terrell Carver's A Marx DictionaryTerrell Carver, A Marx Dictionary. Cambridge: Polity Press, 1987. or in the Historical Dictionary of Marxism.David Walker & Daniel Gray, Historical Dictionary of Marxism. Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, 2007. Jochen Hörisch claims that \"despite its systematic importance, the concept of character masks was conspicuously taboo in the dogmatic interpretation of Marx\".Jochen Hörisch, \"Larven und Charaktermaske – zum elften Kapitel von Ahnung und Gegenwart\", in: Jochen Hörisch,Die andere Goethezeit: Poetische Mobilmachung des Subjekts um 1800. München: Fink, 1998, p. 215. However, Dieter Claessens mentions the concept in his 1992 Lexikon,Dieter Claessens/Karin Claessens, Gesellschaft. Lexikon der Grundbegriffe. Reinbek: Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag GmbH, 1992, p. 44. Compare also Wissenschaftslexikon Wirtschaftslexikon24.net. there is another mention in Lexikon zur SoziologieChristoph Rülcker & Otthein Rammstedt, \"Charaktermaske\". In: Werner Fuchs-Heinritz, Daniela Klimke, Rüdiger Lautmann, Otthein Rammstedt, Urs Stäheli & Christoph Weischer, Lexikon zur Soziologie (4th edition). Wiesbaden: Vs Verlag, 2007, p. 111. and the more recent German- language Historical-Critical Dictionary of Marxism has a substantive entry for character masks by Wolfgang Fritz Haug.Haug, \"Charaktermaske\". See also Wolfgang Fritz Haug, \"Charaktermaske\". In: Martin Papenbrock, Kunst und Sozialgeschichte: Festchrift für Jutta Held. Pfaffenweiler: Centaurus, 1995. Haug suggests that the conjunction of \"character\" and \"mask\" is \"specifically German\", since in the French, English, Spanish, and Italian editions of Capital, Volume I, the term \"mask\", \"bearer\" or \"role\" is used, but not \"character mask\".Wolfgang Fritz Haug, \"Charaktermaske\", p. 436-437. But since \"character mask\" is a technical term in theatre and costume hire – referring both to physical masks expressing specific characters (for example, Halloween masks), and to theatrical roles – it is not \"specifically German\", and most existing translations are simply inaccurate. However, Haug is correct insofar as \"character mask\" as a sociological or psychological term is rarely used by non-German speakers.There is no entry for the term \"character mask\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. However, it is a specialist term in acting theory: see Ozdemir Nutku, \"Style in acting\" (Ankara: Teyatro Keyfi, 2002) . \n",
      "Marx's argument in Das Kapital\n",
      " Marx's argument about character masks in capitalism can be summarizedMichael Heinrich, \"Replik auf Martin Birkner 'Der schmale Grat'\", in: grundrisse. Zeitschrift fur linke theorie und debatte, no. 1, 2002. Grundrisse.net. Eduard Urbánek, \"Roles, Masks and Characters: a Contribution to Marx's Idea of the Social Role\", Social Research, Vol. 34, No. 3, 1967, pp. 529–563. Reprinted in Peter L. Berger (ed.), Marxism and Sociology: Views from Eastern Europe. New York: Meredith Corporation/Appleton- Century-Crofts, 1969. As cited in the latter, p. 170. in six steps. \n",
      "Roles\n",
      " The first step in his argument is that when people engage in trade, run a business or work in a job, they adopt and personify (personally represent) a certain function, role or behaviour pattern which is required of them to serve their obligations; their consent to the applicable rules is assumed, as a necessity to succeed in the activities. They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily have to work with in the division of labour.See Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, chapter 24, part 4. Compare Ilja Srubar, Phänomenologie und soziologische Theorie: Aufsätze zur pragmatischen Lebenswelttheorie. Wiesbaden: Vs Verlag, 2007, p. 301. People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not. If they take on a role, they have to fulfill the packet of tasks which is part of the job. People are initially born into a world in which these social relationships already exist, and \"socialized\" into them in the process of becoming \"well- adjusted adults\" – to the point where they internalize their meaning, and accept them as a natural reality.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin edition, p. 899. See further on this topic, in an American context, e.g. Samuel Bowles (economist) and Herbert Gintis, Schooling in Capitalist America. Routledge, 1976 and research by Melvin Kohn. For an English study, see the classic work by Paul Willis, Learning to Labour: how working class kids get working class jobs. Aldershot: Gower, 1977. Icce.rug.nl Consequently, they can learn to act spontaneously and automatically in a way consistent with these social relations, even if that is sometimes a problematic process. \n",
      "Interests\n",
      " The second step in his argument is that, in acting according to an economic function, employees serve the impersonal (business, legal or political) interests of an abstract authority, which may have little or nothing to do with their own personal interests.Marx/Engels Werke, Band 18. Berlin: Dietz, 1962, p. 274. They have to keep the two kinds of interests separated, and \"manage them\" appropriately in a \"mature, professional\" way.See Ottomeyer, Ökonomische Zwänge und menschliche Beziehungen: Soziales Verhalten im Kapitalismus. Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag, 1977, p. 83. In this way, they \"personify\" or \"represent\" interests, and who they personally are, may be completely irrelevant to that – it is relevant only to the extent that their true personality fits with the role. People are slotted into functions where they have characteristics which are at least compatible with the functions. They always have a choice in how they perform their role and how they act it out, but they have no choice about taking it on. If they succeed in their role, they can advance their position or career, but if they fail to live up to it, they are demoted or fired. Human individuality is then conceptualized in terms of the relationship between buyer and seller.Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, chapter 2 Marxists.org. Compare János Kornai, The socialist system: the political economy of communism. Princeton University Press, 1992, p. 251. The character masks of buyers and sellers are analyzed in Wolfgang Fritz Haug, Kritik der Warenästhetik: Gefolgt von Warenästhetik im High-Tech-Kapitalismus. Suhrkamp Verlag, neuausgabe 2009, pp. 89–98. English edition: Wolfgang Fritz Haug, Critique of commodity aesthetics. Cambridge: Polity Press, 1986, pp. 49f.Wolfgangfritzhaug.inkrit.de Wolfgangfritzhaug.inkrit.de See also Wolfgang Fritz Haug, \"Das Verkaufsgespräch. Charaktermaske von Käufer und Verkäufer\". In: Joachim Dyck (ed.), Rhetorik in der Schule. Kronberg: Scriptor Verlag, 1974, pp. 196–203. \n",
      "Masking\n",
      " The third step in his argument is, that the practices just described necessarily lead to the \"masking\" of behaviors and personalities, and to a transformation of personality and consciousness.For a commentary, see e.g. Lawrence Krader, \"Dialectic of Anthropology\" in: Lawrence Krader, Dialectic of Civil Society. Amsterdam: Van Gorcum, Assen, 1976. It is not just that people can rarely be \"all of themselves\" while performing a specialized function in the division of labour, and must also express something new and different. There are also many competing, conflicting and contradictory interests at stake – and these must somehow be dealt with and reconciled by the living person.See further Michael Eldred, Critique of Competitive Freedom and the Bourgeois-Democratic State: Outline of a Form-analytic Extension of Marx's Uncompleted System. With an Appendix 'Value-form Analytic Reconstruction of the Capital-Analysis' by Michael Eldred, Marnie Hanlon, Lucia Kleiber and Mike Roth, Kurasje, Copenhagen, 1984. Amended, digitized edition 2010 with a new Preface, lxxiii + 466 pp. Different interests have to be constantly mediated and defended in everyday behaviour, with the aid of character masks; these masks exist to mediate conflict. It means that people are obliged or forced to express certain qualities and repress other qualities in themselves. In doing this, however, their own consciousness and personality is altered.Marx/Engels Werke (Berlin), Vol. 15, p. 464. As cited by Urbanek, p. 200. Russell Jacoby, Social amnesia (1975). Transaction publishers, 1997, p. 70. To be part of an organization, or \"rise to the top\" of an organization, they have to be able to \"act out\" everything that it requires in a convincing way, and that can only happen if they either have, or acquire, real characteristics which are at least compatible with it. That requires not just an \"acculturation\" process, but also sufficient behavioral flexibility, intelligence, acumen and creativity – so that a person does not inappropriately \"fall out of the role\". Discord between identity and function is tolerated only in contexts where it does not matter. \n",
      "Inversion\n",
      " The fourth step in his argument concerns an inversion of subject and object. It is not just that the commercial relationships between things being traded begins to dominate and reshape human behaviour, and remake social relations. In addition, human relations become the property of things. Inanimate things, and the relationships between them, are endowed with human characteristics. They become \"actors\" relating in their own right to which people much adjust their behaviour, and they are also theorized in that way.See e.g. Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, chapter 48: \"The Trinity Formula\" (Penguin, 1981, p. 953). This is a special case of anthropomorphism because it occurs within human relations, not in relation to an object external to them. A symbolic language and way of communicating emerges, in which inanimate \"things\" are personified. A market (or a price, or a stock, or a state etc.) gains an independent power to act. Marx calls this commodity fetishism (or more generally, \"fetishism\"), and he regards it as a necessary reification of the symbolizations required to traverse life's situations in bourgeois society, because the relationships between people are constantly being mediated by the relationships between things. It means that people are eventually unable to take their mask off, because the masks are controlled by the business relationships between things being traded, and by broader legal, class, or political interests. If they are actually unable to take the mask off, they have effectively submitted fully to the power of abstract, impersonal market forces and legal rules.Lawrence Krader, \"Marxist anthropology: principles and contradictions.\" International Review of Social History, Volume XX 1975, pp. 255–256. As many philosophical texts suggest, by being habituated to a role, the role is internalized by individuals, and becomes part of their personality: they become the thing that they acted out. \n",
      "Alienation\n",
      " The fifth step in the argument is that on the world's stage, the \"dance of masked people, and of the things they have endowed with an independent power to act and relate\" leads to pervasive human alienation (the estrangement of people from themselves, and from others in contacts which have become impersonal and functional).Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, first manuscript, section \"Estranged Labour\" Marxists.org. For a commentary, see e.g. Bertell Ollman, Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society. Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 1976 It durably distorts human consciousness at the very least, and at worst it completely deforms human consciousness. It mystifies the real nature, and the real relationships, among people and things – even to the point where they can hardly be conceived anymore as they really are. The masks influence the very way in which realities are categorized. People's theorizing about the world also becomes detached from the relevant contexts, and the interpretation of reality then involves multiple \"layers\" of meanings, in which \"part of the story\" hides the \"whole story\". What the whole story is, may itself become an almost impenetrable mystery, about which it may indeed be argued that it cannot be solved.See further e.g. Ernest Mandel, Delightful Murder: A social history of the crime story. Pluto Press, 1984; Linden Peach, Masquerade, crime and fiction. Houndmills, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006; Ernst Bloch, \"A philosophical view of the detective novel (1965)\", in: Bloch, The utopian function of art and literature: selected essays. Cambridge: MIT Press, 1988, pp. 252–253. The real truth about a person may be considered unknowable, but as long as the person can function normally, it may not matter; one is judged simply according to the function performed. In what Marx calls \"ideological consciousness\", interests and realities are presented other than they really are, in justifying and defining the meaning of what happens. People may believe they can no longer solve problems, simply because they lack the categories to \"think\" them, and it requires a great deal of critical and self- critical thought, as well as optimism, to get beyond the surface of things to the root of the problems. \n",
      "Development\n",
      " The last step is that effectively capitalist market society develops human beings in an inverted way. The capitalist economy is not primarily organized for the people, but people are organized for the capitalist economy, to serve others who already have plenty of wealth. In an increasingly complex division of labour offering little job security, there is more and more external pressure forcing people to act in all kinds of different roles, masking themselves in the process; by this act, they also acquire more and more behavioural and semiotic flexibility, and develop more and more relational skills and connections. The necessity to work and relate in order to survive thus accomplishes the \"economic formation of society\" at the same time, even if in this society people lack much control over the social relations in which they must participate. It is just that the whole development occurs in an imbalanced, unequal and uncoordinated way, in which the development of some becomes conditional on the lack of development by others.Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The German Ideology, ed. C.J. Arthur, 1970, p. 116. Commercial interests and political class interests ultimately prevail over the expressed interests of individuals. In the periodic economic crises, masses of people are condemned to the unemployment scrapheap, no matter what skills they may have; they are incompatible with the functioning of the bourgeois system, \"collateral rubbish\" that is swept aside. Even highly developed people can find that society regards them as worthless – which quite often tends to radicalize their opinions (see extremism and radicalization). \n",
      "Revolution\n",
      " A seventh step could in principle be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system. In that case, it could be argued, the false masks are torn off, and people have to stand up for what they really are, and what they really believe in.Sheila Fitzpatrick, Tear Off the Masks!: Identity and Imposture in Twentieth-Century Russia. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005. But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in Das Kapital. \n",
      "Engels\n",
      " The mask metaphor appears in the early writings of Friedrich Engels, and his influence on Marx is often underestimated.Engels, \"Modern literary life\", Mitternachtzeitung für Leser, No. 51-54, March 1840, and No. 83-87, May 1840. Marxists.org. Also \"Marginalia to Texts of our Time\", in: Rheinische Zeitung No. 145, May 25, 1842. Marx/Engels Collected Works, Volume 2. Marxists.org In 1894, Engels referred to character masks in his Preface to Capital, Volume III – when rebutting a criticism of Marx's theory by Achille Loria. Engels's substantive sociological suggestion seems to be that: *in a society's progressive, constructive era, its best characters come to the fore, and no character masks are necessary for them. *when society degenerates and submits to intolerable conditions, it not only gives rise to all sorts of dubious, talentless characters who cannot lead the way forward, but also society's dignity can only be sustained by masking the social contradictions. *based on comprehensive knowledge of a country and its national psychology, it is possible to specify the types of personalities who exemplify the nature of the era. The problem with this kind of argument is just that, in defining the meaning of what is happening in society, it is very difficult to provide definite scientific proof that this meaning is the objective truth. It remains an interpretation, which may make sense of things at a certain level, without providing the whole truth. Engels's comment illustrates that the concept of character masks is not infrequently used in a polemical way to describe a false or inauthentic representation.For a polemical use of the concept of character masks, see: Daniel Cohn-Bendit. Sponti als Charaktermaske. Marxistische Streit- und Zeitschrift, issue 1, 1982. Engels, like Marx, also used the notion of a \"mask\" in the more general sense of a political \"guise\" or \"disguise\", for example in several of his historical analyses about religious movements.Engels, Revolution and Counterrevolution in Germany (1851), chapter 3, translation corrected according to the German original.Marxists.org; Engels, On the history of early Christianity (1894–95) \n",

      "Early Marxism\n",
      " *In his biography of Marx, Franz Mehring refers to character masks, but more in the sense of Weberian ideal types or stereotypical characters.Franz Mehring, Karl Marx: The Story of his Life. London: Routledge 1936, p. 243. *The Marx-Studien published by Rudolf Hilferding and Max Adler referred to character masks as a theoretical category.Josef Karner [=pseud. of Karl Renner ], \"Die Soziale Funktion der Rechts-Institute\", in: Rudolf Hilferding and Max Adler (eds.), Marx-Studien: Blätter zur Theorie und Politik des wissenschaftlichen Sozialismus, Band 1. Vienna: Brand/Wiener Volksbuchhandlung, 1904, pp. 95, 98, 109, 119, 181 etc. *The communist dramatist Bertolt Brecht made extensive use of neutral and character masks. In plays such as The Caucasian Chalk Circle and The Good Person of Szechwan, the masks support what Brecht called \"the alienation effect\" (see distancing effect).The modalities of distancing are explored in: Helmut Lethen, Cool Conduct: The Culture of Distance in Weimar Germany. Robert Boyers, The Legacy of the German refugee intellectuals. Schocken Books, 1972, p. 251. \n",
      "Lukács\n",
      " György Lukács referred to the \"very important category of economic character masks\", but he never provided a substantive analysis of its meaning.György Lukács, History and class consciousness. London: Merlin, 1971, p. 81, note 11; Patrick Eiden-Offe, \"Typing Class: Classification and redemption in Lukács's political and literary theory.\" In: Timothy Bewes and Timothy Hall, Georg Lukács: the fundamental dissonance of existence: aesthetics, politics, literature. London: Continuum, 2011, p. 71. He only referred candidly to his own \"Socratic mask\" in a 1909 love letter to a friend.György Lukács, \"My Socratic Mask. Letter to Charlotte Fereczi, January 1909\". In: Arpad Kadarkay, The Lukács Reader. Oxford: Blackwell, 1995. pp. 57–62. In a 1909 essay, Lukács opined that \"the bourgeois way of life\" is \"only a mask\", which \"like all masks\" negates something, i.e. the bourgeois mask denies vital parts of human life, in the interests of money-making.György Lukács, Soul and form. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1974, p. 56. Lukács restricted the application of the idea to capitalists only, claiming that Marx had considered capitalists as \"mere character masks\"Lukács, \"Reification and the consciousness of the proletariat\", section II, in History and class consciousness. – meaning that capitalists, as the personifications (\"agents\") of capital, did not do anything \"without making a business out of it\", given that their activity consisted of the correct management and calculation of the objective effects of economic laws. Marx himself never simply equated capitalists with their character masks; they were human beings entangled in a certain life predicament, like anybody else.See also: Barbara Roos and J.P. Roos, \"The upper-class way of life: an alternative for what?\". United Nations University Working Paper HSDRGPID-68/UNUP-452, 1983. Cf. Helmut Dahmer, Libido und Gesellschaft, 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1982, p. 319. Capitalists became the \"personification\" of their capital, because they had money which was permanently invested somewhere, and which necessarily had to obtain a certain yield. At most one could say that capitalists had more to hide, and that some had personal qualities enabling them to succeed in their function, while others lacked the personal prerequisites. According to Lukács, the character masks of the bourgeoisie express a \"necessary false consciousness\" about the class consciousness of the proletariat.Haug, \"Charaktermaske\", p. 446-447. Haug borrows this insight about Lukács from Matzner. See: Jutta Matzner, \"Der Begriff der Charaktermaske bei Karl Marx\". In: Soziale Welt. Zeitschrift für sozialwissenschaftliche Forschung und Praxis, Vol. 15, issue 2, 1964, p. 134. See: Christoph Henning, \"Charaktermaske und Individualität bei Marx\", in: Marx-Engels Jahrbuch 2009. Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2010. \n",
      "Post-war Western Marxism\n",
      " In the post-war tradition of Western Marxism, the concept of character masks was theorized about especially by scholars of the Frankfurt School,See e.g. Paul Connerton, The tragedy of enlightenment: an essay on the Frankfurt School. Cambridge University Press, 1980, chapter 3. and other Marxists influenced by this school. Most of the Frankfurt theorists believed in Freud's basic model of human nature. Erich Fromm expanded it by developing the social-psychological concept of \"social character\".Erich Fromm, Escape from freedom. New York: Avon books, 1965, p. 304-305. *It also appears in Marxist-existentialist thought, such as in the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre.Casimir R. Bukala, \"Sartre's Phenomenology Of The Mask.\" In: Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology, Vol. 7, October 1976, pp. 198–203. William Keith Tims, Masks and Sartre's Imaginary. In his famous book Being and Time, Heidegger distinguished between the \"they-self\", i.e. the self that is just \"being there\", in common view, and the authentic self, the \"self-aware\" self who explicitly grasps his own identity.Martin Heidegger, Being and Time. New York: State University of New York Press, 1996, p. 121. *In a radical synthesis of Marx and Freud, Wilhelm Reich created the concept of \"character armor\". It refers to the total \"harness\" of physiological defences which mask off the pain of repressing feelings – feelings which the individual is not permitted to express in civil life, or is unable to express adequately.Wilhelm Reich, Character Analysis. New York: Farrar, Straus, & Giroux, 1949. Cf. Helmut Dahmer, Libido und Gesellschaft, 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1982, p. 318. Masking is nowadays acknowledged by behavioural scientists to be also a purely biological or psychophysical process in sentient organisms: neurologically, the subjective experience of some perceived stimuli by the organism is modified or distorted by the intervention of other perceived stimuli. It can have a critically important effect on the ability of the organism to make choices, orient itself, or display sensitivity. Reich's idea was developed further by Arthur Janov, where the primal scream breaks through the masks of the body and its behaviour. *In the philosophy of the Marxist semiotician Roland Barthes, the mask features primarily as a \"sign\" with fixed meanings.David Wiles, Mask and Performance in Greek Tragedy: From Ancient Festival to Modern Experimentation. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 116–124. *The concept of character masks was used by Anglo-Saxon Western Marxist or post-Marxist thinkers like Perry Anderson, Werner Bonefeld, Paul Connerton, Michael Eldred, Russell Jacoby, Lawrence Krader, and Michael Perelman. János Kornai also refers to it. In Germany and Austria, the concept has been used in the Marxian tradition by Elmar Altvater, Ingo Elbe, Wolfgang Fritz Haug, Michael Heinrich, Robert Kurz, Ernst Lohoff, Klaus Ottomeyer, and Franz Schandl (as cited in the notes). \n",
      "Theodor Adorno\n",
      " Adorno argues that Marx explained convincingly why the appearance-form and the real nature of human relations often does not directly coincide, not on the strength of a metaphysical philosophy such as transcendental realism,On transcendental realism, see: Roy Bhaskar, A realist theory of science (2nd ed.). Hassocks, Sussex: Harvester Press, 1978. but by inferring the social meaning of human relations from the way they observably appear in practical life – using systematic critical and logical thought as a tool of discovery. Every step in the analysis can be logically and empirically tested.Cf. Herbert Marcuse: \"The transcendence leading from facts to essence is historical. Through it, given facts are understood as appearances whose essence can be comprehended only in the context of particular historical tendencies aiming at a different form of reality\". Negations. Essays in Critical Theory. London: MayFlyBooks, 2009, p. 53. The hermeneutic assumption is that these relations require shared meanings in order to be able to function and communicate at all. These shared presuppositions have an intrinsic rationality, because human behaviour – ultimately driven by the need to survive – is to a large extent purposive (teleological), and not arbitrary or random (though some of it may be). If the \"essential relationships\" never became visible or manifest in any way, no science would be possible at all, only speculative metaphysics. It is merely that sense data require correct interpretation – they do not have a meaning independently of their socially mediated interpretation. In that sense, the mask presupposes the existence of something which for the time being remains invisible, but which can be revealed when one discovers what is behind the mask. It may be that the essence suddenly reveals itself on the stage of history, or more simply that the understandings which one already has, are altered so that the essence of the thing is finally grasped. \n",
      "Frankfurt School analysis\n",
      " Inspired by Marx's concept of character masks, the founder of the Frankfurt School, Max Horkheimer, began to work out a critical, social- psychological understanding of human character in the so-called Dämmerung period (in 1931/34).Gunzelin Schmid Noerr, \"Zwischen Sozialpsychologie und Ethik – Erich Fromm und die 'Frankfurt Schule',\" in: Mitteilungen des Instituts für Sozialforschung, Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität, Frankfurt, Heft 11. September 2000, pp. 7–40. Cited according to the version in the online Erich Fromm Archive, p. 5. Erich-fromm.de Horkheimer stated the Frankfurt School perspective clearly: The Frankfurt School, and especially Herbert Marcuse, was also concerned with how people might rebel against or liberate themselves from the character-masks of life in bourgeois society, through asserting themselves authentically as social, political and sexual beings. The Frankfurt School theorists intended to show, that if in bourgeois society things appear other than they really are, this masking is not simply attributable to the disguises of competitive business relationships in the marketplace. It is rooted in the very psychological make-up, formation and behaviour of individual people. In their adaptation to bourgeois society, they argued, people internalize specific ways of concealing and revealing what they do, repressing some of their impulses and expressing others. If people are dominated, they are not dominated only by forces external to themselves, but by ideas and habits which they have internalized, and accept as being completely \"natural\". Max Horkheimer puts it as follows: \"The principle of domination, based originally on brute force, acquired in the course of time a more spiritual character. The inner voice took the place of the master in issuing commands.\"Max Horkheimer, \"The revolt of nature\" (1947). In: Max Horkheimer, Eclipse of reason. New York: Continuum, 2004, p. 72. \n",
      "=Contradictory masks\n",
      "= The \"masking\" of an alienated life, and the attempts to counteract it, are thought of in these Marxist theories as co- existing but contradictory processes,Theodor W. Adorno, Negative Dialektik. In: Gesammelte Schriften 6, Frankfurt: 1997. involving constant conflicts between what people really are, how they present themselves, and what they should be according to some external requirement imposed on them – a conflict which involves a perpetual struggle from which people can rarely totally withdraw, because they still depend for their existence on others, and have to face them, masked or unmasked.See e.g. Ute Grabowski, Persönlichkeitsentwicklung im Beruf: das Problem des Kompromisses zwischen Persönlichkeit und Charaktermaske.

      "=The struggle for identity\n",
      "= To the extent that the commercial and public roles impose heavy personal burdens, and little space exists anymore \"to be oneself\", people can experience personal stress, mental suffering and personal estrangement (alienation), sometimes to the point where they \"lose themselves\", and no longer \"know who they are\" (identity crisis).See e.g. the writings of Erich Fromm. The concept of \"identity crisis\" was originally made popular by the post-Freudian psychologist Erik Erikson. *People may continue to function routinely (\"the silent compulsion of economic relations\"Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, chapter 28, Penguin edition, p. 899.), sublimating, suppressing or masking the contradictions, perhaps in a schizoid way, as a zombie, as a psychopath, or by becoming withdrawn. In that case, Erich Fromm argues, human beings can become wholly conformist \"automatons\" (\"the automation of the individual\") in which a \"pseudo self\" replaces the \"original self\" – \"The pseudo self is only an agent who actually represents the role a person is supposed to play, but who does so under the name of the self.\"Erich Fromm, Escape from freedom, 2nd edition. New York: Avon Books, 1965, p. 229-230. Ultimately, there exists no individual solution to such identity problems, because to solve them requires the positive recognition, acceptance and affirmation of an identity by others – and this can only happen, if the individual can \"join in\" and receive social acknowledgement of his identity. Marx himself tackled this problem – rather controversially – in his 1843/44 essay \"On the Jewish Question\". \n",

      "Dialectical difficulties\n",
      " Much of the scientific controversy about Marx's concept of character masks centres on his unique dialectical approach to analyzing the forms and structure of social relations in the capitalist system: in Das Kapital, he had dealt with persons (or \"economic characters\") only insofar as they personified or symbolized – often in a reified way – economic categories, roles, functions and interests (see above). According to Marx, the capitalist system functioned as a \"system\", precisely because the bourgeois relations of production and trade, including property rights, were imposed on people whether they liked it or not. They had to act and conform in a specific way to survive and prosper. As the mass of capital produced grew larger, and markets expanded, these bourgeois relations spontaneously reproduced themselves on a larger and larger scale, be it with the assistance of state aid, regulation or repression.See Capital, Volume I, chapter 25 and 26. However, many authors have argued that this approach leaves many facets of capitalist social relations unexplained.See e.g. Michael Lebowitz, Beyond Capital: Marx's Political Economy of the Working Class, 2nd edition. Palgrave Macmillan, 2003 and Marcel van der Linden & Karl Heinz Roth (eds.), Über Marx hinaus: Arbeitsgeschichte und Arbeitsbegriff in der Konfrontation mit den globalen Arbeitsverhältnissen des 21. Jahrhunderts. Hamburg: Assoziation A, 2009. In particular, it is not so easy to understand the interactions between individuals and the society of which they are part, in such a way, that each is both self-determining and determined by the other. Marx's concept of character masks has been interrogated by scholars primarily in the German- language literature. Werner Sombart stated in 1896 (two years after Capital, Volume III was published) that \"We want a psychological foundation of social events and Marx did not bother about it\".Werner Sombart, Sozialismus und soziale Bewegung im 19. Jahrhundert. Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1896, p. 72. As cited by Reiner Grundmann and Nico Stehr, \"Why Is Werner Sombart Not Part of the Core of Classical Sociology? \", in: Journal of Classical Sociology, Vol. 1 no. 2 July 2001, p. 261. \n",
      "Soviet Union\n",
      " The historian Sheila Fitzpatrick has recorded how, in the Soviet Union, \"The theatrical metaphor of masks was ubiquitous in the 1920s and '30s, and the same period saw a flowering of that peculiar form of political theater: the show trial.\"Sheila Fitzpatrick, Tear Off the Masks!: Identity and Imposture in Twentieth-Century Russia. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 13. Those who supported the revolution and its communist leadership were politically defined as \"proletarian\" and those who opposed it were defined as \"bourgeois\". The enemies of the revolution had to be hunted down, unmasked, and forced to confess their counter-revolutionary (i.e. subversive) behaviour, whether real or imagined. It led to considerable political paranoia. Abandoning bourgeois and primitive norms, and becoming a cultured, socialist citizen, was \"akin to learning a role\".Fitzpatrick, p. 13. In the 1920s, the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP) adopted the slogan \"tear off each and every mask from reality\". This was based on a quotation from Lenin, who wrote in his 1908 essay on Leo Tolstoy as mirror of the Russian revolution that the \"realism of Tolstoy was the tearing off of each and every mask\"(sryvanie vsekh i vsiacheskikh masok).Fitzpatrick, p. 65 note. See V.I. Lenin, \"Leo Tolstoy as mirror of the Russian revolution\" (Proletary, No. 35, September 11 (24), 1908), in: Collected Works, Vol. 15, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1977, p. 205. Marx2mao.com The communist authorities kept detailed files on the class and political credentials of citizens, leading to what historians call \"file- selves\".Fitzpatrick, p. 14. Much later, in 1973 (16 years before Slavoj Žižek entered the intellectual scene) the German New Left critic Michael Schneider claimed that: According to this interpretation, there was a \"blind spot\" in Marx's explanation of bourgeois society, because he had disregarded psychological factors. Moreover, Marxists had interpreted Marx's theory of the \"personification of economic functions\" as an alternative to psychology as such. Thus, equipped with a simplistic \"reflection theory of consciousness\" and an \"objectivist concept of class consciousness\", the Russian revolutionaries (naively) assumed that once the bourgeois had been liberated from his property, and the institutions of capitalism were destroyed, then there was no more need for masking anything – society would be open, obvious and transparent, and resolving psychological problems would become a purely practical matter (the \"re-engineering of the human soul\"). Very simply put, the idea was that \"the solution of psychological problems is communism\". However, Raymond A. Bauer suggests that the communist suspicion of psychological research had nothing directly to do with the idea of \"character masks\" as such, but more with a general rejection of all approaches which were deemed \"subjectivist\" and \"unscientific\" in a positivist sense (see positivism).Raymond A. Bauer, The new man in Soviet psychology. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1952, p. 67, p. 90 and p. 180. The USSR became increasingly interested in conceptions of human nature which facilitated social control by the communist party, and from this point of view, too, the concept of the unconscious was problematic and a nuisance: by definition, the unconscious is something which cannot easily be controlled consciously. However, psychoanalysis was considered bourgeois; this situation began to change only gradually Nikita Khrushchev had made his famous secret speech, in which he condemned the \"personality cult\" around Stalin (see \"On the Personality Cult and Its Consequences\"). The obligatory official broadsides against Freud and the neo-Freudians in the Soviet Union ceased only from 1972, after which psychoanalysis was to a large extent rehabilitated.Miller, op.cit., chapter 8, p. 146 et seq. \n",
      "The New Left and the Red Army Faction\n",
      " The New Left was a radical trend which began in 1956/57, a time when large numbers of intellectuals around the world resigned from the \"Old Left\" Communist parties in protest against the Soviet invasion of Hungary during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. These New Left intellectuals broke with the official Marxism–Leninism ideology, and they founded new magazines, clubs and groups, which in turn strongly influenced a new generation of students. They began to study Marx afresh, to find out what he had really meant. In Germany, the term Charaktermaske was popularized in the late 1960s and in the 1970s especially by \"red\" Rudi Dutschke, one of the leaders of the student radicals.\"'Charaktermaske' bei Marx Larven der Bürger entlarven.\" Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 19 July 1995, Nr. 165, p. N6. Also e.g. \"Wir fordern die Enteignung Axel Springers. SPIEGEL-Gespräch mit dem Berliner FU-Studenten Rudi Dutschke (SDS)\". In: Der Spiegel, issue 29, 10 July 1967. Spiegel.deGermanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org By \"character masks\", Dutschke meant essentially that the official political personalities and business leaders were merely the interchangeable \"human faces\", the representatives or puppets masking an oppressive system; one could not expect anything else from them, than what the system required them to do. Focusing on individual personalities was a distraction from fighting the system they represented. According to the German educationist Ute Grabowski, The positive utopian longing emerging in the 1960s was that of reaching a life situation in which people would be able to meet each other naturally, spontaneously and authentically, freed from any constraints of rank or status, archaic rituals, arbitrary conventions and old traditions.Fredric Jameson, \"On Goffman's Frame Analysis,\" Theory and Society 3, no. 1 (Spring 1976), p. 122. In their social criticism, the youth began to rebel against the roles which were formally assigned to them, and together with that, began to question the social theory of roles,R.W. Connell, \"The concept of role and what to do with it\". In: R.W. Connell, Which way is up? Essays on sex, class and culture. Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1983, pp. 189–207. which presented those roles as natural, necessary and inevitable.David Caute, The year of the barricades: a journey through 1968. Harper Collins, 1988. In particular, the women's liberation movement began to challenge gender roles as sexist and patriarchal. There seemed to be a big gap between the façade of roles, and the true nature of social relationships, getting in the way of personal authenticity (being \"for real\"). Official politics was increasingly regarded as the \"masquerade\" of those in power. To illustrate the spirit of the times, Anne-Marie Rocheblave-Spenlé who had previously authored a classic French text on role theory, in 1974 published a book titled, significantly, Le Pouvoir Demasque (Power unmasked).Anne-Marie Rocheblave-Spenlé, Le Pouvoir Demasque. Paris: Editions Universitaires, 1974. The concept of \"character masks\" was by no means an unimportant political concept in Germany, since it was being used explicitly by terrorists in their justifications for assassinating people.Ulrike Meinhof, \"Armed Anti- Imperialist Struggle (and the Defensive Position of the Counterrevolution in its Psychologic Warfare Against the People)\".

      "Ten points of controversy\n",
      " Questions subsequently arose in New Left circles about ten issues: *whether behaviour is in truth an \"act\" or whether it is \"for real\", and how one could know or prove that (the problem of authenticity).This and some of the other issues are referred to by Christoph Henning, \"Charaktermaske und Individualität bei Marx\", in: Marx-Engels Jahrbuch 2009.

German sociologist Uri Rapp theorized that Charaktermaske was not the same as \"role\"; rather Charaktermaske was a role forced on people, in a way that they could not really escape from it, i.e. all their vital relationships depended on it. People were compelled by the relations of production. Thus, he said, \"every class membership is a Charaktermaske and even the ideological penetration of masquerades (the 'class consciousness of the proletariat') could not change or cast off character masks, only transcend them in thought.\" In addition, Charaktermaske was \"present in the issue of the human being alienated from his own personality.\"Uri Rapp, Handeln und Zuschauen. Untersuchungen über den theatersoziologischen Aspekt in der menschlichen Interaktion. Darmstadt: Luchterhand, 1973, p. 147. Referred to by Munz, op. cit., p. 26. Jean L. Cohen complained that: As the post-war economic boom collapsed in the 1970s, and big changes in social roles occurred, these kinds of controversies stimulated a focus by social theorists on the \"social construction of personal identity\". A very large academic literature was subsequently published on this topic, exploring identity-formation from many different angles.See e.g. Donald Pollock, \"Masks and the Semiotics of Identity.\" Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. 1, no. 3, 1995, pp. 581–97. The discourse of identity resonated well with the concerns of adolescents and young adults who are finding their identity, and it has been a popular subject ever since. Another reason for the popularity of the topic, noted by Richard Sennett in his book The corrosion of character, is the sheer number of different jobs people nowadays end up doing during their lifetime.Richard Sennett, The Corrosion of Character: the Personal Consequences Of Work In the New Capitalism. New York: Norton, 1998. People then experience multiple changes of identity in their lifetime – their identity is no longer fixed once and for all. \n",
      "Humanism and anti-humanism\n",
      " Marx's \"big picture\" of capitalism often remained supremely abstract,See e.g. Geert Reuten & Michael Williams, Value- form and the State. The Tendencies of Accumulation and the Determination of Economic Policy in Capitalist Society. London: Routledge, 1989. although he claimed ordinary folks could understand his book.Letter of Karl Marx to Ludwig Kugelmann, 11 July 1868. Marx/Engels Collected Works, Vol. 43, p. 67. Marxists.org It seemed to many scholars that in Marx's Capital people become \"passive subjects\" trapped in a system which is beyond their control, and which forces them into functions and roles. Thus, it is argued that Marx's portrayal of the capitalist system in its totality is too \"deterministic\", because it downplays the ability of individuals as \"active human subjects\" to make free choices, and determine their own fate (see also economic determinism).For a commentary see e.g. Paul Blackledge, Marxism and Ethics; Freedom, Desire, and Revolution. New York: SUNY Press, 2012. The theoretical point is stated by Peter Sloterdijk as follows: In the antihumanist version, the individual is viewed as \"a creation of the system\" or \"a product of society\" who personifies a social function. In this case, a person selected to represent and express a function is no more than a functionary (or a \"tool\"): the person himself is the character mask adopted by the system or the organization of which he is part. Hidden behind the human face is the (inhuman) system which it operates. In the humanist version, the process is not one of personification, but rather of impersonation, in which case the function is merely a role acted out by the individual. Since the role acted out may in this case not have much to do with the individual's true personality, the mask-bearer and the mask he bears are, in this case, two different things – creating the possibility of a conflict between the bearer and the role he plays. Such a conflict is generally not possible in the antihumanist interpretation (\"if you work for so-and-so, you are one of them\"), since any \"dysfunctional\" character mask would simply be replaced by another. \n",
      "=Louis Althusser's anti-humanism\n",
      "= In the antihumanist philosophy of the French Marxist Louis Althusser, individuals as active subjects who have needs and make their own choices, and as people who \"make their own history\", are completely eradicated in the name of \"science\".Miriam Glucksmann, Structuralist analysis in contemporary social thought. A comparison of Claude Levi-Strauss and Louis Althusser. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 112-113. In fact, Althusser recommended the psychological theory of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan in the French Communist Party journal La Nouvelle Critique specifically as a \"science of the (human) unconscious\".Louis Althusser, \"Freud and Lacan\" (1964), in: Althusser, Lenin and philosophy and other essays. London: NLB, 1971. Marx2mao.com In the glossary of his famous book Reading Capital (co-written with Étienne Balibar), Althusser announces: Critics of this idea argue people are not merely the \"bearers\" of social relations, they are also the \"conscious operators\" of social relations – social relations which would not exist at all, unless people consciously interacted and cooperated with each other. The real analytical difficulty in social science is, that people both make their social relations, but also participate in social relations which they did not make or consciously choose themselves. Some roles in society are consciously and voluntarily chosen by individuals, other roles are conferred on people simply by being and participating in society with a given status. Some roles are also a mixture of both: once people have chosen a role, they may have that role, whether they like it or not; or, once habituated to role, people continue to perform the role even although they could in principle choose to abandon it. That is why both the humanist and the antihumanist interpretations of character masks can have some validity in different situations. According to some critics, Althusser's \"totalizing perspective\"Selbourne, \"Two essays on method\", Critique: Journal of Socialist Theory, Vol. 10 No. 1, pp. 77–78. Althusserian theoreticism was ridiculed by the historian E. P. Thompson in The Poverty of Theory and Other Essays. London: Merlin Press, 1978, but defended by Perry Anderson in his 1980 book Arguments within English Marxism. – which, by destroying the dialectics of experience, cannot reconcile the ways in which people \"make history\" and are \"made by history\", and therefore falls from one contradiction into another and destroys belief in the power of human action (because \"the system\" dominates everything). \n",
      "The sociological imagination\n",
      " C. Wright Mills developed a concept known as the sociological imagination, the idea being that understanding the link between \"private troubles\" and \"public issues\" requires creative insight by the researchers, who are personally involved in what they try to study. The analytical question for social scientists then is, how much the concept of \"character masks\" can really explain, or whether its application is overextended or overworked. For example, Jon Elster argued that: Jürgen Ritsert, a Frankfurt sociologist, queried the utility of the concept of character masks: \n",
      "Sociobiology\n",
      " Faced with the problem of understanding human character masks – which refers to how human beings have to deal with the relationship between the \"macro- world\" (the big world) and the \"micro-world\" (the small world)*Christian Fuchs, Wolfgang Hofkirchner and Bert Klauninger, Vienna University of Technology INTAS Project \"Human Strategies in Complexity \" Paper, No. 8, delivered at the Congress \"Problems of Individual Emergence\", Amsterdam, April, 16th–20th 2001. – scholarship has often flip-flopped rather uneasily between structuralism and subjectivism, inventing dualisms between structure and agency.Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, The new spirit of Capitalism. London: Verso, 2005, p. x. See e.g. Perry Anderson, Arguments within English Marxism. Random House Inc., 1980. The sociological debate about structure and agency is reviewed by George Ritzer in Modern sociological theory. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003. The academic popularity of structural-functionalism has declined, \"role definitions\" have become more and more changeable and vague, and the Althusserian argument has been inverted: human behaviour is explained in terms of sociobiology.See: \"A biological understanding of human nature: a talk with Steve Pinker\", 9 September 2002. Edge.org Here, \"the person\" is identified with \"the physical body\". This is closer to Marx's idea of \"the economic formation of society as a process of natural history\", but often at the cost of \"naturalizing\" (eternalizing) social phenomena which belong to a specific historical time – by replacing their real, man-made social causes with alleged biological factors. On this view, humans (except ourselves) are essentially, and mainly, animals. The treatment of humans as if they are animals is itself a strategy of domination.Staff reporter, \"Foxconn chairman likens his workforce to animals\", WantChinaTimes (Taipei), 19 January 2012. \n",
      "Postmodernism\n",
      " The more recent postmodern criticism of Marx's portrayal of character masks concerns mainly the two issues of personal identity and privacy. It is argued that modern capitalism has moved far beyond the type of capitalism that Marx knew.Manuel Castells, The Power of Identity. The Information Age: Economy, Society, and Culture, Volume II. Second edition, Chichester, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010. Capitalist development has changed the nature of people themselves, and how one's life will go is more and more unpredictable.Theodor W. Adorno, Minima Moralia [1951]. London: Verso, 2005, p. 37. There is no longer any clear and consensual view of how \"personal identity\" or \"human character\" should be defined (other than by identity cards).Pauline Marie Rosenau, Post-modernism and the social sciences: insights, inroads, and intrusions. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1992. It is also no longer clear what it means to \"mask\" them, or what interests that can serve.Amalia Rosenblum, \"Goodbye to privacy\". Ha'aretz, 11 November 2010. Haaretz.com Roles are constantly being redefined to manipulate power relationships, and shunt people up or down the hierarchy. The postmodern concept of human identity maximizes the flexibility, variability and plasticity of human behaviour, so that the individual can \"be and do many different things, in many different situations\", without any necessary requirement of continuity between different \"acts\" in space and time. The effect as a lack of coherence; becomes more difficult to know or define what the identity of someone truly is. As soon as the self is viewed as a performance, masking becomes an intrinsic aspect of the self, since there still exists an \"I\" which directs the performance and which therefore simultaneously \"reveals and conceals\" itself. The corollary is, that it becomes much more difficult to generalize about human beings. The most basic level the categories or units used to make comparisons remain vague. At most, one can objectively measure the incidence and frequency of different types of observable behaviour. Aggregate human behaviour is then often explained either as a biological effect or as a statistical effect, estimated by probability theory. Some Marxists regard this perspective as a form of dehumanization, which signifies a deepening of human alienation, and leads to a return to religion to define humanity. Modern information technology and the sexual revolution, it is nowadays argued, have radically altered the whole idea of what is \"public\" and what is \"private\".See further e.g. Jürgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991 and Christian Fuchs, \"Towards an alternative concept of privacy\". Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, Vol. 9 No. 4, 2011, pp. 220–237. Fuchs.uti.at Increasingly, information technology becomes a tool for social control. Some Marxists even refer to the spectre of totalitarian capitalism.See e.g. George Liodakis, Totalitarian Capitalism and Beyond. Farnham: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2010. Human individuals then appear to be caught up in a stressful battle to defend their own definition of themselves against the definitions imposed or attributed by others, in which they can become trapped. \n",

      "= In their famous 1989 article \"The class struggle fetish\", the German neo-Marxists Robert Kurz and Ernst Lohoff reached the conclusion that the working class is ultimately just \"the character mask of variable capital\", a logical \"real category\" of Capital.

London: Verso, 2006. In Žižek's theory, oppressive social reality cannot exist and persist without ideological mystification, \"The mask is not simply hiding the real state of things; the ideological distortion is written into [the] very essence [of the real state of things].\"Slavoj Žižek, The sublime object of ideology. London: Verso, 1989, pp. 25. Thus, the mask is a necessary and integral component of an oppressive reality, and it is not possible to tear away the mask to reveal the oppressive reality underneath. In The sublime object of ideology, Žižek summarizes Peter Sloterdijk's concept of cynical reason: Often the pretense is kept up, because of a belief (or anxiety) that the alternative – i.e. dropping the pretense – would result in a negative effect, and compromise cherished values or beliefs. To maintain and build a team morale, results are dependent on shared beliefs, regardless of the integrity and awareness of those belief's within reality. The result, Žižek claims, is a \"symbolic order\" of \"fetishist disavowal\" in which people act morally \"as if\" they are related in certain ways – to the point where \"the symbolic mask matters more than the direct reality of the individual who wears this mask.\"Slavoj Žižek, Ideology III: to read too many books is harmful. Lacan.com, 1997. Lacan.com Using a Freudian theory, Žižek aims to explain the psychological processes by which people are reconciled with the symbolic order, or at least make it \"liveable\" for themselves (see also Freudo- Marxism). Frank Furedi suggests that the concept of denial, central to Žižek's understanding of masks, has a stark contrast from contemporary post-Freudian society: \"In today's therapy culture, people who express views that contradict our own are often told that they are 'in denial'. It has become a way of discrediting their viewpoint, or shutting them up.\"Frank Furedi, \"Denial\", in: Spiked, 31 January 2007. If people disagree, or will not cooperate, they are not taken seriously in a dialogue, but accused of having a psychological problem which stands in need of professional treatment. Thus, a dissident is neutralized by being turned into a patient who is \"unhealthy\", and people are managed according to psychotherapeutic concepts designed to invalidate their own meanings.Frank Furedi, Therapy Culture: Cultivating Vulnerability in an Uncertain Age. Taylor & Francis, 2003. Furedi implies that yesterday's leftist concepts can be recycled as today's tools for psychological manipulation: an idea which originally had a progressive intention can evolve until, in reality, it plays the very opposite role – even although (and precisely because) people continue to sentimentally cherish the old idea. The point is not simply to interpret the processes by which oppressed people are reconciled with, or reproduce their own oppression (Althusser's and Bourdieu's structuralist theory of \"ideological reproduction\"); the challenge is to create new ideas which can free the oppressed out of their oppression. For this purpose, ideas have to be situated according to how they are actually being used in the real world, and the oppressed have to be regarded as active subjects who can change their own fate. Philip Rieff summarizes the main problem, and the main achievement of psychoanalysis, from the point of view of freeing people from the masks that may oppress them: If it is true that \"we do not even know who we are\", then it becomes difficult to understand how people could free themselves from deceptive masks, and change the world for the better, unless they all get a massive dose of psychotherapy to \"find themselves\". \n",
      "Unmasking\n",
      " If one successfully unmasks something, one understands it for what it really is, and can handle it; inversely, if one understands something and can handle it, it is unmasked.Fritjof Bönold states: \"Marx selber hatte den widersprüchlichen Begriff Charaktermaske verwendet. Er betont einerseits die Einprägung (Charakter) der gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse in die Person, andererseits die Möglichkeit der Demaskierung.\"[\"Marx himself used the contradictory term character mask. He stressed on the one hand the imprinting (character) of social relations in the person, yet on the other hand the possibility of unmasking.\"] – Bönold, \"Zur Kritik der Geschlechtsidentitätstheorie\", p. 14 note 11. See further his essay \"Die (un)abgeschlossene Debatte um Gleichheit oder/ und Differenz in der pädagogischen Frauenforschung\". In: Zeitschrift für Frauenforschung & Geschlechterstudien, Vol. 22, issue 1, 2004, pp. 18–30. Yet, as Marx notes, \"in the analysis of economic forms neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of assistance. The power of abstraction must replace both.\"Capital, Volume I, Penguin, p. 90. Economic analysis not only studies the total social effect of human actions, which is usually not directly observable to an individual, other than in the form of statistics or television. The \"economic actors\" are also human beings who create interactions and relationships which have human meanings. Those meanings cannot be observed directly, they are in people's heads, actively created in their social relationships, and expressed symbolically. \n",
      "Collapse\n",
      " Capitalism unmasks itself in the course of development, when its internal contradictions become so great, that they cause collapse – impelling the revolutionary transformation of capitalism by human action into a new social order, amidst all the political conflicts and class struggles.Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin, p. 929. Marxists.org The concept of collapse is denied by many Marxists, but in the history of capitalism undeniably many countries have experienced such a collapse. This, however, did not lead automatically to socialism, and it did not prevent business from reviving after a few years. Capitalism can collapse, but it can also recover. In trying to get on top of the relations they have created, human beings are themselves transformed. Scientific inquiry, Marx felt, should be an aid in the cause of human progress, to ensure that the new social order emerging will be a real open society. Human progress is achieved, to the degree that people abolish the oppressions of people by other people, and oppressions by the blind forces of nature.Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., pp. 958–959. \n",

After the blotting, the transferred proteins, DNA or RNA are then visualized by colorant staining (for example, silver staining of proteins), autoradiographic visualization of radiolabelled molecules (performed before the blot), or specific labelling of some proteins or nucleic acids. The latter is done with antibodies or hybridization probes that bind only to some molecules of the blot and have an enzyme joined to them.

      " Plot \n",
      " During a sing-along at Camp Hiawatha in 1981, two revelers sneak away to have sex and are killed by an unseen assailant. Twenty-four years later, four friends (Angela, Jen, Mario, and Vade) are driving through the area on their way to Boston. The quartet becomes lost (passing the same sign several times) and their SUV breaks down after night comes unusually early. All the electronics fail to work, and the group is thrown into hysterics when screams emanate from the surrounding forest, and the vehicle is pelted with debris, prompting them to spend the night in it. In the morning, the travelers are found by campers and counselors from Hiawatha, and invited to stay at the camp, which looks like it has not changed since the 1980s. As the quartet is shown around (noticing how anachronistic the place is) someone murders any campers who go off on their own or in a pair. That night, the killer rampages through the facilities, butchering everyone except the quartet. At dawn, the travelers awaken to discover that nothing appears to be wrong and that everyone is alive again. Daniel and Ivan, a pair of counselors who are aware of what is going on, find the four, and explain that the camp is in a time loop, stuck repeating the day of the killing spree. To prove they are telling the truth, the counselors take the others to witness the first murder, a strangulation in the woods, which they have never been able to stop, despite their best efforts. The time-displaced four try to leave on their own, but the SUV will not appear until nightfall, and walking away just brings them back to Hiawatha. Daniel and Ivan state that they are limited in what they can do, but with the help of outsiders, they may be able to break the loop and move on to whatever fate awaits them. The night of the massacre, it is revealed that Daniel and Ivan are the murderers and that they manipulated Michelle and Ruben, a pair of outcasts, into helping them with their thrill killing. The psychopaths intend to have the travelers take their place in the cycle, which they believe they can achieve by murdering them, so they can get out. Mario and Vade die, but Angela and Jen manage to kill Daniel and Ivan. The girls go to the SUV, where Lou, the groundskeeper, is attacking Michelle and Ruben. Lou snaps Michelle's neck and exposits that he took out the perpetrators of the original massacre minutes after it occurred. A wounded Ruben then shoots an arrow into Angela's chest and is stomped to death by Lou as Jen escapes in the SUV. Three years later, Jen has become a successful writer, and while in her office one day, she receives an email. It is from Daniel and Ivan, who have written that they cannot wait to meet their \"favorite author\" soon. \n",

      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1908 film)\n",
      "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a 1908 silent horror film starring Hobart Bosworth, and Betty Harte in her film debut. Directed by Otis Turner and produced by William N. Selig, this was the first film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novel Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The screenplay was actually adapted by George F. Fish and Luella Forepaugh from their own 1897 four act stage play derived from the novel, causing a number of plot differences with the original source. Despite Stevenson's protests, this film became the model which influenced all the later film adaptations that were to come.Haberman, Steve (2003). \"Silent Screams\". Midnight Marquee Press. p. 15. Roy Kinnard states it is also considered to be the first American horror film. There are no known existing copies of the film today. \n",
      "Plot\n",
      " The film begins with the raising of a stage curtain. Dr. Jekyll vows his undying love for Alice, a vicar's daughter, in her spacious garden. Suddenly, seized by his addiction to the chemical formula, Jekyll begins to convulse and distort himself into the evil Mr. Hyde. He savagely attacks Alice, and when her father tries to intervene, Mr. Hyde takes great delight in slaughtering him. While in his lawyer's office, Dr. Jekyll sees visions of himself being executed for his crime. Hyde later visits a friend Dr. Lanyon to ask him to procure some chemicals he needs, and after drinking the potion, he transforms back into Jekyll right before the doctor's eyes. Later in his lab, Jekyll transforms back into Mr. Hyde again, but haunted by visions of the gallows, he takes a fatal dose of poison, killing both of his identities simultaneously. In true theatrical tradition, the curtain then closes. \n",
      "Production\n",
      " The screenplay was adapted by George F. Fish and Luella Forepaugh based on their own 1897 four act stage play, which was condensed into a 16-minute long film. Selig thought the screenplay he used was based directly on Stevenson's novel, not realizing it had been adapted from Fish and Forepaugh's stage play instead, causing some plot differences. Selig erroneously commented upon its release that his film was \"presented in strict accordance with the original book....involving each detail of pose, gesture and expression.....executed by persons of indisputed dramatic ability.\" Despite its brevity, the film was also organized into four acts, just like the play. Each act consisted of a single scene, and the acts were separated onscreen by the rising and falling of a curtain. Selig produced a number of films from this period in much the same way, as if a static camera had simply photographed a stage play that was in progress. The film was released seven months after the death of stage actor Richard Mansfield. (Mansfield had created the part of Jekyll/Hyde in the theater in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the first stage adaptation written by Thomas Russell Sullivan, beginning in 1887.) To cash in on the popularity of their 1908 film, the Selig Polyscope company released another version of the Jekyll-Hyde story (running 7 minutes) in 1909 called A Modern Dr. Jekyll, which updated the story to a contemporary setting. Jekyll's formula was depicted as more of a magic potion in that film, and even transforms him into a woman in one scene. The 1909 film is also considered lost. \n",
      "Critiques\n",
      " Jekyll's transformation into Hyde was filmed all in one continuous shot without the use of any special effects. Bosworth simply contorted his body into a hunchbacked position and slid part of the wig he was wearing lower down over his forehead. Critics were enthusiastic, giving Bosworth special mention: \"The change is displayed with a dramatic ability almost beyond comprehension\". Motion Picture World opined \"The successful reproduction of this well-known drama surpassed our expectations\".Kinnard, Roy (1995). \"Horror in Silent Films\". McFarland and Company Inc. .

      "answer: title: Data access object\n",
      "In software, a data access object (DAO) is a pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides data operations without exposing database details. This isolation supports the single responsibility principle. It separates the data access the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types (the DAO's public interface), from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS (the implementation of the DAO). Although this design pattern is applicable to most programming languages, most software with persistence needs, and most databases, it is traditionally associated with Java EE applications and with relational databases (accessed via the JDBC API because of its origin in Sun Microsystems' best practice guidelines \"Core J2EE Patterns\". \n",
      " Advantages \n",
      " The primary advantage of using data access objects is the rigorous separation between two parts of an application that have no need to know anything about each other, and which therefore can evolve frequently and independently. Changing business logic can rely on a constant DAO interface, while changes to persistence logic do not affect DAO clients. All details of storage are hidden from the rest of the application (see information hiding). Unit testing code is facilitated by substituting a test double for the DAO in the test, thereby making the tests independent of the persistence layer. In the context of the Java programming language, DAO can be implemented in various ways. This can range from a fairly simple interface that separates data access from the application logic, to frameworks and commercial products. Technologies like Java Persistence API and Enterprise JavaBeans come built into application servers and can be used in applications that use a Java EE application server. Commercial products such as TopLink are available based on object-relational mapping (ORM). Popular open source ORM software includes Doctrine, Hibernate, iBATIS and JPA implementations such as Apache OpenJPA. \n",
      " Disadvantages \n",
      " Potential disadvantages of using DAO include leaky abstraction, code duplication, and abstraction inversion. In particular, the abstraction of the DAO as a regular Java object can obscure the high cost of each database access. Developers may inadvertently make multiple database queries to retrieve information that could be returned in a single operation. If an application requires multiple DAOs, the same create, read, update, and delete code may have to be written for each DAO.See http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-genericdao/index.html for workarounds \n",

As a result, the storyline of the Childe Morgan Trilogy immediately precedes Deryni Rising, despite the fact that it was published over thirty years after the first novel. \n",
      "Plot introduction\n",
      " The novel is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms. Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom similar to the British Isles of the 12th century, with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of Gwynedd includes both humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent psychic and magical abilities who have been shunned and persecuted for centuries. The book takes place almost entirely within Gwynedd's capital city of Rhemuth, and deals primarily with the struggle of young Prince Kelson Haldane to secure his throne from the machinations of a Deryni usurper. \n",
      "Plot summary\n",
      " The book covers a two-week period in November 1120, beginning with the death of King Brion Haldane while leading a hunting party outside the city of Rhemuth. Immediately following Brion's death, his son and heir, Prince Kelson sends for his father's closest friend and advisor, Alaric Morgan, the Deryni Duke of Corwyn. Morgan arrives shortly before Kelson's coronation, but his efforts to assist the prince are interrupted by Kelson's mother, Queen Jehana. However, Kelson manages to thwart Jehana's attempts to imprison Morgan, and the duke resumes his efforts to protect Kelson. Morgan informs Kelson that Brion had wielded magical powers of his own, despite the fact that Brion was not Deryni. Known as \"the Haldane potential\", it is a trait of the Haldane line to acquire Deryni-like powers once they have been activated in the subject. Morgan believes that Brion designed a magical ritual to awaken those powers in Kelson. Furthermore, Morgan suspects that Kelson will need those powers to defend himself from Princess Charissa Furstána-Festila, a Deryni sorceress who intends to attack Kelson during his coronation and claim the throne of Gwynedd. During the course of the night, Morgan and his cousin, Monsignor Duncan McLain, attempt to decipher the clues left by Brion. After a bloody encounter in the royal crypt, the cousins discover that they both possess the Deryni talent for Healing, an ability that has been lost for two centuries. They eventually attempt to activate Kelson's magical abilities, but are disappointed when the ritual appears to fail. Later that night, Morgan encounters Charissa in the palace and the sorceress proudly admits to murdering Brion. During Kelson's coronation the following morning, Charissa appears and challenges the prince to a Duel Arcane, an ancient form of magical combat. Morgan attempts to answer the challenge in his role as King's Champion, but Charissa's own champion seriously wounds the Deryni duke before being defeated, leaving Morgan unable to deal with Charissa herself. However, seeing her son's danger, Jehana attacks Charissa with magic, revealing that her fanatical hatred of Deryni has concealed her own Deryni heritage. Nonetheless, Charissa easily defeats Jehana, and Kelson is forced to personally duel with the sorceress. As the combat is about to begin, Kelson suddenly unravels the last of his father's clues and activates his own powers. Using both his Haldane powers and his newly discovered Deryni heritage, Kelson manages to defeat Charissa. With the Pretender now dead, Kelson is crowned as King of Gwynedd. \n",

      "Awards and nominations\n",
      " Deryni Rising was a finalist for the 1971 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for outstanding work in the field of fantasy literature. The other finalists were Lloyd Alexander's The Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian and Roger Zelazny's Nine Princes in Amber. However, the award was won by Mary Stewart for her novel, The Crystal Cave. In 1971, Deryni Rising ranked 12th in an annual poll of Locus magazine readers, placing it between Dean Koontz's Beastchild and D. G. Compton's Chronocules. (The poll was won by Larry Niven's Ringworld.) In a 1987 poll, the readers of Locus ranked Deryni Rising as the 29th greatest fantasy novel of all time, placing it in a tie with E. R. Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros. In 1998, Locus conducted a survey to determine the greatest fantasy novels published before 1990, and Deryni Rising was ranked 30th by the magazine's readers. Both the 1987 poll and the 1998 poll were won by J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. \n",

Ashley and Jack eat at a diner, and Jack promises to talk to his brother, a former drug dealer on medication for bipolar disorder, about being responsible. The following night, Jack receives a short, garbled call from a frightened Ashley. He races to Ashley's home and finds Garret, Ashley’s mother and Ashley, as well as the family's dog, all shot dead. The police rule the case a murder-suicide by Garret. Despite consolation from his partner Bobby, who has been assigned the case, Jack blames himself; he is convinced that his stern talk with Garret sparked his horrific actions. Two weeks later, Jack begins receiving calls from Ashley's phone, even though the line has been disconnected. When he answers, Ashley speaks to him as though nothing is wrong. Jack soon realizes that he is somehow communicating through the phone with Ashley from several days before her murder. Ashley herself is oblivious to her fate and does not know she is speaking to Jack in the future. Jack does not tell Ashley the confusing truth, but hopes that with his guidance she can alter events to prevent the murder-suicide. From this point forward, the film cuts between Jack in the present and Ashley in the past. As Jack in the present investigates leads Ashley uncovers in the past, he becomes convinced that Garret was framed for the crime. Jack finds reference to a \"Georgie;\" his captain, Howard, tells Jack that Georgie is a possibly mythical drug kingpin whom rumors have tied to numerous major drug deals for years. Jack is convinced that the mysterious Georgie is the real murderer. While investigating, Jack is fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting. As he is dying, Ashley calls him and he orders her to call the police to arrest her father for drug possession, and tells her to call his partner Bobby if she thinks she is in danger. Jack hopes that these actions will prevent Ashley's murder; instead, only the date and specific details of the triple homicide change. Ashley altering the past also changes Jack's own past actions, meaning that he is not shot and is unharmed. When he realizes that Ashley's murder now occurred a day earlier, the day that Ashley is currently in, Jack tells Ashley the truth about their phone calls and her fate. He begs her to leave town to survive, and she agrees. Jack meets with Howard and Bobby, who reveal that \"Georgie\" is not a person, but a group of crooked cops. Howard and Bobby have been helping internal affairs track down this conspiracy within the department. They take Jack to a discreet location to discuss the investigation. Bobby suddenly shoots Howard dead, revealing that he is a member of the Georgie conspiracy. He was tasked with eliminating Garret after Garret refused to assist them with a major drug deal. Bobby killed the family and framed Garret. Meanwhile, in the past, Ashley has called Bobby for a ride home, planning to have him protect her family. However, when they arrive, Bobby shoots Garret and Ashley's mother dead. Ashley flees. In the present, Bobby, assuming that all Jack's evidence must come from an informant, demands to know who Jack's witness is. Jack then receives a call from Ashley which he answers, holding up the phone for Bobby to hear. He urges Ashley to save herself, which will save him. Bobby prepares to shoot Jack. In the past, Ashley leads the pursuing Bobby to Jack's house. After briefly communicating with his future self in silence, the past version of Jack comes out and sees his blood-covered partner preparing to shoot Ashley.

      "History\n",
      " thumbnail|left|Painting of Carrie Estelle Doheny.|175px In 1944, Carrie Estelle Doheny, wife of the prominent Los Angeles oilman Edward L. Doheny, became blind in her left eye and began to suffer a progressive loss of sight in her right eye. The loss of vision inspired her to create and fund the organization named for her, the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation, in 1947. The foundation was formed with the purpose of supporting \"the conservation, improvement and restoration\" of human eyesight. The Doheny Pavilion, at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, opened to patients in 1956. Drs. A. Ray Irvine, Sr., and S. Rodman Irvine served as co-Medical Directors. Dr. A. Ray Irvine, Sr., served as the personal ophthalmologist of Carrie Estelle Doheny, as well of American entrepreneur Walt Disney. In 1966, USC invited the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation Trustees to inspect an available parcel on the USC Health Sciences Campus, and negotiations to acquire the property began. In 1971, the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation finalized its formal affiliation agreement with USC, and named William H. Spencer, MD, as its new medical director, forming what was then called the \"Doheny Eye Institute.\" In 1977, Stephen J. Ryan became medical director and proposed the creation of the Doheny Eye Hospital, to serve as a new headquarters and provide clinical facilities for the ophthalmology faculty. The hospital was officially dedicated in 1985. In 1987, the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation was renamed the Doheny Eye Institute, and a $32 million campaign was launched to build the Doheny Eye Institute building. Shortly thereafter, Stephen J. Ryan became President of the institute. In 1992, TV personality Gene Autry was honored as the first recipient of the institute's Doheny Award. The Doheny Retina Institute was established in 2001, followed by the Doheny Image Reading Center (DIRC) in 2003. Doheny and USC ended their relationship in 2012, and USC created a new entity called the USC Eye Institute for its department of ophthalmology. In December 2013 the Doheny Eye Institute entered into an exclusive, long-term affiliation agreement with the University of California Los Angeles, forming the \"Doheny Eye Center UCLA\". Ronald E. Smith had served as Chairman of Ophthalmology at USC from 1995 to 2013, and left USC to follow Doheny, and became vice chair of the department at UCLA. \n",

      "original_text: What is Dean Koontz's real name?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Dean Koontz\n",
      "Dean Ray Koontz (born July 9, 1945) is an American author. His novels are billed as suspense thrillers, but frequently incorporate elements of horror, fantasy, science fiction, mystery, and satire. Many of his books have appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list, with fourteen hardcovers and sixteen paperbacks reaching the number-one position. Koontz wrote under a number of pen names earlier in his career, including \"David Axton\", \"Deanna Dwyer\", \"K.R. Dwyer\", \"Leigh Nichols\" and \"Brian Coffey\". He has published over 105 novels and a number of novellas and collections of short stories, and has sold over 450 million copies of his work. \n",
      " Early life \n",
      " Koontz was born on July 9, 1945, in Everett, Pennsylvania, the son of Florence (née Logue) and Raymond Koontz. He has said that he was regularly beaten and abused by his alcoholic father, which influenced his later writing, as also did the courage of his physically diminutive mother in standing up to her husband. In his senior year at Shippensburg State College, he won a fiction competition sponsored by Atlantic Monthly magazine.Piazza, Judyth: \"Judyth Piazza chats with Dean Koontz and Mark Constant, The Market on Granada\" St. Augustine News, July 27, 2009 After graduation in 1967, he went to work as an English teacher at Mechanicsburg High School in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. In the 1960s, Koontz worked for the Appalachian Poverty Program, a federally funded initiative designed to help poor children. In a 1996 interview with Reason magazine, he said that while the program sounded \"very noble and wonderful, ... [i]n reality, it was a dumping ground for violent children ... and most of the funding ended up 'disappearing somewhere.'\" This experience greatly shaped Koontz's political outlook. In his book, The Dean Koontz Companion, he recalled that he > \"... realized that most of these programs are not meant to help anyone, > merely to control people and make them dependent. I was forced to reconsider > everything I'd once believed. I developed a profound distrust of government > regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on > civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi- > libertarian on all other matters.\" \n",
      " Career \n",
      " In his spare time, Koontz wrote his first novel, Star Quest, which was published in 1968. Koontz went on to write over a dozen science fiction novels. Seeing the Catholic faith as a contrast to the chaos in his family, Koontz converted in college because faith provided existential answers for life; he admired Catholicism's \"intellectual rigor,\" saying it permitted a view of life that saw mystery and wonder in all things.Rossi, Tony, Best- selling Author Dean Koontz Explores Catholic Values in Novels Catholic Exchange, August 1, 2009 He says he sees Catholicism as English writer and Catholic convert G. K. Chesterton did: that it encourages a \"joy about the gift of life\". Koontz says that spirituality has always been part of his books, as are grace and our struggle as fallen souls, but he \"never get[s] on a soapbox\". In the 1970s, Koontz began writing suspense and horror fiction, both under his own name and several pseudonyms, sometimes publishing up to eight books a year. Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several editors convinced him that authors who switched back and forth between different genres invariably fell victim to \"negative crossover\" (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige, and Anthony North. As Brian Coffey, he wrote the \"Mike Tucker\" trilogy (Blood Risk, Surrounded, Wall of Masks) in acknowledged tribute to the Parker novels of Richard Stark (Donald E. Westlake). Many of Koontz's pseudonymous novels are now available under his real name. Many others remain suppressed by Koontz, who bought back the rights to ensure they could not be republished; he has, on occasion, said that he might revise some for republication, but only three have appeared — Demon Seed and Invasion were both heavily rewritten before they were republished, and Prison of Ice had certain sections bowdlerised. After writing full-time for more than 10 years, Koontz had his acknowledged breakthrough novel with Whispers, published in 1980. The two books before that, The Key to Midnight and The Funhouse, also sold over a million copies, but were written under pen names. His first bestseller was Demon Seed, the sales of which picked up after the release of the film of the same name in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year. His first hardcover bestseller, which finally promised some financial stability and lifted him out of the midlist hit-and-miss range, was his book Strangers. Since then, 12 hardcovers and 14 paperbacks written by Koontz have reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list. Bestselling science fiction writer Brian Herbert has stated, \"I even went through a phase where I read everything that Dean Koontz wrote, and in the process I learned a lot about characterization and building suspense.\" In 1997, psychologist Katherine Ramsland published an extensive biography of Koontz based on interviews with his family and him. This \"psychobiography\" (as Ramsland called it) often showed the conception of Koontz's characters and plots from events in his own life. Early author photos on the back of many of his novels show a balding Koontz with a mustache. After Koontz underwent hair transplantation surgery in the late 1990s, his subsequent books have featured a new, clean-shaven appearance with a fuller head of hair. Koontz explained the change by claiming that he was tired of looking like G. Gordon Liddy. Many of his novels are set in and around Orange County, California. As of 2006, he lives there with his wife, Gerda (Cerra), in Newport Coast, California, behind the gates of Pelican Hills. In 2008, he was the world's sixth-most highly paid author, tied with John Grisham, at $25 million annually. In 2019, Koontz began publishing with Amazon Publishing. At the time of the announcement, Koontz was one of the company's most notable signings. \n",
      " Pet dogs \n",
      " One of Koontz's pen names was inspired by his dog, Trixie Koontz, a Golden Retriever, shown in many of his book-jacket photos. Trixie originally was a service dog with Canine Companions for Independence (CCI), a charitable organization that provides service dogs for people with disabilities. Trixie was a gift from CCI in gratitude of Koontz's substantial donations, totaling $2.5 million between 1991 and 2004. Koontz was taken with the charity while he was researching his novel Midnight, a book which included a CCI-trained dog, a black Labrador Retriever, named Moose. In 2004, Koontz wrote and edited Life Is Good: Lessons in Joyful Living in her name, and in 2005, Koontz wrote a second book credited to Trixie, Christmas Is Good. Both books are written from a supposed canine perspective on the joys of life. The royalty payments of the books were donated to CCI. In 2007, Trixie contracted terminal cancer that created a tumor in her heart. The Koontzes had her euthanized outside their family home on June 30. After Trixie's death, Koontz has continued writing on his website under the name \"TOTOS\", standing for \"Trixie on the Other Side\". Trixie is widely thought to have been his inspiration for his November 2007 book, The Darkest Evening of the Year, about a woman who runs a Golden Retriever rescue home, and who rescues a \"special\" dog, named Nickie, which eventually saves her life. In August 2009, Koontz published A Big Little Life, a memoir of his life with Trixie. In October 2008, Koontz revealed that he had adopted a new dog, Anna. Eventually, he learned that Anna was the grandniece of Trixie. Anna died on May 22, 2016. Koontz then adopted a new dog, Elsa, on July 11, 2016. \n",
      " Disputed authorship \n",
      " A number of letters, articles, and novels were ostensibly written by Koontz during the 1960s and 1970s, but he has stated he did not write them. These include 30 erotic novels, allegedly written together by Koontz and his wife Gerda, including books such as Thirteen and Ready!, Swappers Convention, and Hung, the last one published under the name \"Leonard Chris\". They also include contributions to the fanzines Energumen and BeABohema in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including articles that mention the erotic novels,BeABohehma #8, 1970, ed. Frank Lunney; page 5 such as a movie column called \"Way Station\" in BeABohema. Koontz wrote in How to Write Best Selling Fiction, a much revised and updated version of 'Writing Popular Fiction' (1972),Writer's Digest Books, 1981, pp18 \"During my first six years as a full-time novelist ... I wrote a lot of ephemeral stuff; anything that would pay some bills ... I did Gothic romance novels under a pen-name ... Like many writers, I did some pornography too, and a variety of other things, none of which required me to commit my heart or my soul to the task. (This is not to say I didn't bother to do a good job; on the contrary, I never wrote down to any market, and I always tried to give my editors and readers their money's worth.)\" The Gothic novels are identifiable, but none of Koontz's acknowledged work fits into the latter category. Koontz has stated on his website that he used only the ten known pen names and \"there are no secret pen names used by Dean\"; he adds that his own identity was stolen by \"a person he had previously worked with professionally\", who submitted letters and some articles to fanzines under Koontz's name between 1969 and at least the early 1970s. Koontz has stated that he was only made aware of these bogus letters and articles in 1991 in a written admission from the identity thief. He has stated that he will reveal this person's name in his memoirs. \n",

      "original_text: What is the method commonly used to detect genetically modified organisms (GMOs)?\n",
      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Detection of genetically modified organisms\n",
      "The detection of genetically modified organisms in food or feed is possible by biochemical means. It can either be qualitative, showing which genetically modified organism (GMO) is present, or quantitative, measuring in which amount a certain GMO is present. Being able to detect a GMO is an important part of GMO labeling, as without detection methods the traceability of GMOs would rely solely on documentation. \n",
      "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n",
      " The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemistry and molecular biology technique for isolating and exponentially amplifying a fragment of DNA, via enzymatic replication, without using a living organism. It enables the detection of specific strands of DNA by making millions of copies of a target genetic sequence. The target sequence is essentially photocopied at an exponential rate, and simple visualisation techniques can make the millions of copies easy to see. The method works by pairing the targeted genetic sequence with custom designed complementary bits of DNA called primers. In the presence of the target sequence, the primers match with it and trigger a chain reaction. DNA replication enzymes use the primers as docking points and start doubling the target sequences. The process is repeated over and over again by sequential heating and cooling until doubling and redoubling has multiplied the target sequence several million-fold. The millions of identical fragments are then purified in a slab of gel, dyed, and can be seen with UV light. It is not prone to contamination. Irrespective of the variety of methods used for DNA analysis, only PCR in its different formats has been widely applied in GMO detection/analysis and generally accepted for regulatory compliance purposes. Detection methods based on DNA rely on the complementarity of two strands of DNA double helix that hybridize in a sequence-specific manner. The DNA of GMO consists of several elements that govern its functioning. The elements are promoter sequence, structural gene and stop sequence for the gene. \n",
      "Quantitative detection\n",
      " Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) is used to measure the quantity of a PCR product (preferably real-time, QRT-PCR). It is the method of choice to quantitatively measure amounts of transgene DNA in a food or feed sample. Q-PCR is commonly used to determine whether a DNA sequence is present in a sample and the number of its copies in the sample. The method with currently the highest level of accuracy is quantitative real-time PCR. QRT-PCR methods use fluorescent dyes, such as Sybr Green, or fluorophore-containing DNA probes, such as TaqMan, to measure the amount of amplified product in real time. If the targeted genetic sequence is unique to a certain GMO, a positive PCR test proves that the GMO is present in the sample. \n",
      "Qualitative detection\n",
      " Whether or not a GMO is present in a sample can be tested by Q-PCR, but also by multiplex PCR. Multiplex PCR uses multiple, unique primer sets within a single PCR reaction to produce amplicons of varying sizes specific to different DNA sequences, i.e. different transgenes. By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes, i.e., their base pair length, should be different enough to form distinct bands when visualized by gel electrophoresis. \n",
      "Event-specific vs. construct- specific detection\n",
      " When producers, importers or authorities test a sample for the unintended presence of GMOs, they usually do not know which GMO to expect. While EU authorities prefer an event-specific approach to this problem, US authorities rely on construct-specific test schemes. \n",
      "Event- specific detection\n",
      " An event-specific detection searches for the presence of a DNA sequence unique to a certain GMO, usually the junction between the transgene and the organism's original DNA. This approach is ideal to precisely identify a GMO, yet highly similar GMOs will pass completely unnoticed. Event- specific detection is PCR-based. \n",
      "Construct-specific detection\n",
      " The construct-specific detection methods can either be DNA or protein based. DNA based detection looks for a part of the foreign DNA inserted in a GMO. For technical reasons, certain DNA sequences are shared by several GMOs. Protein- based methods detect the product of the transgene, for example the Bt toxin. Since different GMOs may produce the same protein, construct-specific detection can test a sample for several GMOs in one step, but is unable to tell precisely which of the similar GMOs are present. Especially in the USA, protein-based detection is used for the construct-specific approach. \n",
      "Shortcomings of current detection methods\n",
      " Currently, it is highly unlikely that the presence of unexpected or even unknown GMOs will be detected, since either the DNA sequence of the transgene or its product, the protein, must be known for detection. In addition, even testing for known GMOs is time- consuming and costly, as current reliable detection methods can test for only one GMO at a time. Therefore, research programmes such as Co-Extra are developing improved and alternative testing methods, for example DNA microarrays. \n",
      "Alternative detection methods\n",
      " \n",
      "Improving PCR based detection\n",
      " Improving PCR based detection of GMOs is a further goal of the European research programme Co-Extra. Research is now underway to develop multiplex PCR methods that can simultaneously detect many different transgenic lines. Another major challenge is the increasing prevalence of transgenic crops with stacked traits. This refers to transgenic cultivars derived from crosses between transgenic parent lines, combining the transgenic traits of both parents. One GM maize variety now awaiting a decision by the European Commission, MON863 x MON810 x NK603, has three stacked traits. It is resistant to an herbicide and to two different kinds of insect pests. Some combined testing methods could give results that would triple the actual GM content of a sample containing this GMO. \n",
      "Detecting unknown GMOs\n",
      " Almost all transgenic plants contain a few common building blocks that make unknown GMOs easier to find. Even though detecting a novel gene in a GMO can be like finding a needle in a haystack, the fact that the needles are usually similar makes it much easier. To trigger gene expression, scientists couple the gene they want to add with what is known as a transcription promoter. The high- performing 35S promoter is a common feature to many GMOs. In addition, the stop signal for gene transcription in most GMOs is often the same: the NOS terminator. Researchers now compile a set of genetic sequences characteristic of GMOs. After genetic elements characteristic of GMOs are selected, methods and tools are developed for detecting them in test samples. Approaches being considered include microarrays and anchor PCR profiling. \n",
      "Near infrared fluorescence (NIR)\n",
      " Near infrared fluorescence (NIR) detection is a method that can reveal what kinds of chemicals are present in a sample based on their physical properties. By hitting a sample with near infrared light, chemical bonds in the sample vibrate and re-release the light energy at a wavelength characteristic for a specific molecule or chemical bond. It is not yet known if the differences between GMOs and conventional plants are large enough to detect with NIR imaging. Although the technique would require advanced machinery and data processing tools, a non-chemical approach could have some advantages such as lower costs and enhanced speed and mobility. \n",

      " \n",
      "Eon family\n",
      " The Eon family is the legendary family that defeated the General. Only Eon, Marty, and his father have been mentioned, but all members are great warriors and martial artists. The General's forces wiped out the family through the years leaving Marty the sole blood heir to the family legacy. Their ancestral home is a huge fortress surrounded by a bamboo forest. Underneath the home is the family's ancestral training ground that includes wood training drones and tests to hone the family's martial arts skills. The home has fallen into great disrepair since the death of Marty's father. *Eon - Eon was the hero who ended the Second Robot War by destroying the General, but unfortunately he died in the process. His weapon, later called the Fist of Eon, was passed down through his family for 100 years. He has only spoke to Marty once, although it was a hologram of him that actually spoke to him in The Temple of the Iron Soul where he once trained to learn control of the fist. * Martin (Marty) - Marty, or Eon kid, is the lead character of the series. While scavenging for robot parts to sell he finds the Fist of Eon and puts it on, although unwillingly. Marty later discovers that he is a direct descendant of Eon, who 100 years prior to the series' start defeated the General and ended the Robot War. Endowed with the power of the Fist, he must fight the evil forces of the General. He was originally named Iron Kid in the original Korean version. Marty is the last descendant of the Eon family and is also the last heir of Eon. He is the final carrier of the Fist. He's shown to possess a natural talent for fighting and grows stronger as the series goes on. * Gaff - An ancient robot who has served the Eon family for more than 130 years. He safeguarded the fist for one hundred years until its successor, Marty, was found. Somewhat a mentor to Marty, has watched over the Eon family for years and defended the family from the General's forces as best he could. His weapon is the Dragon Sword. *Master Zhang - An unofficial member of the Eon family, Master Zhang waited for the Fist's successor at the family's ancestral home. He is a martial artist master who has trained several generations of the Eon family. Although he is quite old, he is still a formidable teacher and opponent but can be quite silly. *Charlie - Charlie is another unofficial member of the Eon family. It is revealed that he was the administrator of the Eon family, a student of Marty's biological father, and perhaps his best friend. During an attack he flees with Marty and raises him as his own, per his real father's instructions. He was later captured by Black Beauty shortly after Marty flees to Crystal City. * Marty's father - While his name was not revealed. he is seen in multiple episodes, most notably his final moments against Scar and his army of ninjas. \n",
      "Marty's friends\n",
      " * Ally -- A mysterious girl who runs into Marty and becomes his friend. She is the adoptive daughter of Duke Von Rhymer. She has the ability to read and decipher the computer code that was used to make the General and other robotic creations during that time. Most of her life has been spent in the Iron Tower, but she quickly adapts to the outside world and becomes Marty's close friend and also crush and likes him back. * Buttons — Marty's robotic dog and good friend. He constantly talks too much and provides great comic relief. He has a stretched out tail, that stretches super far, and by twisting his ear, it puts him on bark mode. \n",
      "Government Central Defence Federation (CDF)\n",
      " * Captain Magnum -- The leader of a group of soldiers in the Central Federation Army. He and his troops wear blue armor. He brought Marty to the government's attention. His weapons are a pair of cannons mounted in his arms and a set of missiles hidden within his upper body armor. He is a robot created by the CDF. * Violet -- A special agent and spy for the CDF. She infiltrates the Iron Tower and discovers the General's resurrection. She later tutors Ally and becomes her good friend and surrogate big sister. She uses purple force fields and some purple attacks launched from her hands (an example was seen during her battle against Steeljaw Jack). She is a robot created by the CDF. * Shadow -- A rehabilitated criminal who now works for the CDF. He has 108 combat weapons and is an expert at covert ops. He was reprogrammed after an 18-month hunt for him, only Captain Magnum was able to subdue him. He is 99% loyal as he sometimes forgets which side he is on, and could constantly change as he did once while fighting the invincible lords, and he saved Marty from falling but then almost released him. * Chief Gibson -- The leader of the CDF. He is the one in charge of all the operations and duties of the soldiers and makes all the decisions about what to do, although sometimes his decisions come too late. He has access to the vault where the General's mechanical heart is stored in the top floor. * Kelly -- Chief Gibson's secretary and right-hand woman. She does all the research for Chief Gibson and is the main speaker who briefs the leaders of the CDF forces in. The ace squadrobots -- A squadron of robots for the CDF that can turn into mini planes with rockets. \n",
      "The General's forces\n",
      " * General -- The General was the ultimate robot in his day who ended the first Robot War that involved the Gigantors. He was created by a pooling of the world's greatest technology around a supernatural human brain. The experiment was a success, but the General started the Second Robot War when he decided robots were superior and he should rule. The Second Robot War ended with his defeat 100 years before the series began when Eon used his mighty fist to destroy him in a suicide attack. Unfortunately the General's brain survived and was saved by his followers. Since his defeat his followers have worked in secret to collect his many pieces and rebuild him so that they can once again take over the world. However, since his defeat, the General lost his sense of honor and resorted to more harsh methods like using the very Gigantor he was built to destroy. He has a red coating which is so powerful even light cannot enter it. Also using his red force field gave headaches to the CDF troops and then killed them. Note: In the English version of the series, he was infrequently called 'General Khan' before a second character named Khan was formally introduced in the episode 'The Fall of Iron Tower'. * Doctor Chen -- An evil man who was a CDF scientist who secretly left the organization with the General's heart. Years later, Chen personally spearheads the General's reconstruction, later becoming his chief strategist when he sets out to take over the world. After Ally took control over The Giganator he escaped and was never seen anymore. * Khan -- Khan is second-in-command only to the General himself, following him out of honor. During the Robot War he was unstoppable, taking out an entire Federation battalion alone. He acts as a leader to the General's forces after his defeat until he is rebuilt, with Khan horrified of his leader's new outlook. He mainly battles using his fighting skills and brute strength, but is also capable of creating winds from his hand that either pull or push his enemies, and can fire a set of rockets from his shoulder armor. Sometimes he'll arm himself with a personal convoy of heavy infantry missile packs worn on both arms to fight colossal threats such as the Giganator. * The Four Invincible Lords—The four invincible lords are four of the General's most powerful allies (also his henchmen). They are each named after a weather condition; Lightning, Rain, Wind, and Cloud. They are quite large and carry abilities that link them to their names. They each are designed with gold-colored armour and red and orange flame patterned loincloths. There is one female robot and three males. Combined they can create a powerful storm. The robot named Lighting uses his blade to fire attacks, Rain uses his two shields which have spikes on them, Wind (the most powerful member and leader of the Four Invincible Lords) uses some ropes to fight and Cloud uses a large club in battle. * Black Beauty -- A kunoichi robot whose main goal is to take the Fist of Eon from Marty and is a rival to Gaff who defeated her while Marty was training. She was at the General's side during the Robot War and never let a target escape. She leads an army of black-armored ninja robots and fights with the black knife, the black dagger, the black decker, her secret sword, the black sword, and other daggers and illusion powers. * Scar -- Scar was one of the General's most trusted fighters during the Robot Wars, a rival of Black Beauty's in rank and has his own personal lackeys. His past is shrouded in mystery and no one knows where he came from. He carries two large axes that he uses for battle. He is also equipped with battle claws that have an organic toxin that he uses when in close combat against other robots. He was eventually defeated for good by Marty while he was under the influence of the Fist of Eon. * Eiger -- Eiger is an enormous robot who was the General's most powerful warrior. He was encased in ice by Eon 100 years ago. As a statue of ice he is easily recognizable at the entrance to the Temple of the Iron Soul in the Mystic Glacier. When Marty comes near the glacier the ice is melted from the sheer power of the fist, with Eiger attacking Marty under the assumption that he was Eon. But in the end, Marty defeats him. His strongest skill is the ability to create a snow storm which he uses against Marty but Marty uses his meteor blast attack, finally killing him. *Centaurs -- Centaurs are the main component of the General's army. They are called his cavalry, resemble their mythological counterparts and are led by one with golden armor. * The Giganator -- A giant robotic creature with many weapons. Khan and the General tried to stop him but when the General was resurrected he uses Chen to bring back the Giganator and use it against the CDF. \n",
      "Other villains\n",
      " * Duke Von Rhymer-- The evil chairman of the Iron Tower and Ally's stepfather. He was secretly helping Chen in rebuilding the General while carrying his own agenda involving the Gigantor. However, Von Rhymer was betrayed by Chen once the Gigantor is operational and ends up incarcerated in CDF. * Steeljaw Jack -- A robot created by Doctor Chen who currently sits atop the government's most wanted list as a hired mercenary. He is an accomplished fighter and has no match in the government forces. Though he overpowered Marty when he was sent to bring Ally back to the Iron Tower, Steeljaw Jack is defeated by the boy and Violet in their rematch. He drives a silver convertible that acts as his personal mode of transportation which resembles an Aston Martin. His design looks similar to Cad Bane from Star Wars: The Clone Wars. \n",
      "Others\n",
      " *Orange Mama -- Orange Mama is the leader of the Orange Bandit, a group of outlaw robots that ravage the desert. *George -- A former robot fighting champion who helped Marty and Ally through the Orange Valley. *Jenny -- Orange Mama's granddaughter and a friend of Ally. *The Bullybots-- These three robots try to become master thieves like Espinoza, their idol and lead the good life. The group consists of Och, Tito, and Waddy. They follow Marty to try and steal the fist of Eon. They consider Buttons their boss, after he defeated them in a quick sparring match, and help out Marty and Buttons in the future. *The White Monks-- A group of small robots that guard the Temple of the Iron Soul. They worship Eiger and follow a very different story about him. They believe that he is Eiger the Patient, who 100 years ago, roamed the glaciers in search of enlightenment in which he came to a stop at the Temple of the Iron Soul and has since then waited patiently. * The Great Espinoza- The greatest master thief amongst all robots and the idol of the three bullybots. * Ranzi's Law- a gargantuan enemy Marty fights in the seventh episode. \n",

She was the daughter of Teikweidi, one of the last traditional clan leaders of the village, and his wife Susie Bremner, granddaughter of John James Bremner, a Scottish prospector and guide, who helped the U.S. Army explore the Copper River area in the 1880s.

      " She studied at the Sage Memorial School of Nursing, in Granado, Arizona, graduating at the top of her class, in 1952, and went on to work for two years as a nurse on Navajo reservations in Arizona. She then returned to Alaska, and served in hospitals in Juneau, Sitka (at the Mount Edgecumbe School), and Bethel, at a time when diphtheria and tuberculosis were predominant health threats in those areas. She played a leading role in the opening of the Alaska Native Health Services Hospital in Anchorage in 1954.\"Elaine Ramos Abraham.\" Alaska Native Science Commission. www.nativescience.org. Retrieved 2016-05-25. In the early 1960s, she worked together with Dr. James Justice at Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital, in Sitka, in organizing the Southeast Health Aide Program, to meet the healthcare needs of Alaskan Natives living in remote villages; that program became the model for the statewide Alaska Native Health Aide Program. \n",
      "Education administration\n",
      " In the early 1970s, after retiring from nursing, Abraham pursued a bachelor's degree in human resources development, as well as a masters in \"Teaching in Multi-Ethnic Education,\" both at Alaska Pacific University, in Anchorage. Subsequently, she served in administrative posts at Sheldon Jackson College, in Sitka, beginning as associate dean of students, then becoming director of special services, and, finally, vice president for institutional development. While at Sheldon Jackson she initiated the Tlingit and Haida Language Teachers Training Program, and contributed to the writing of the Alaska Legislation for Bilingual Education.Jennings, Michael (2004). Alaska Native Political Leadership and Higher Education: One University, Two Universes. Lanham, MD: Altamira Press. . p. 97. In 1976 Abraham joined the University of Alaska system as vice president of the newly created Division of Rural Educational Affairs, based in Anchorage, becoming the first woman and the first Native American to hold a senior statewide administrative position at the university. During her brief tenure (the position was eliminated shortly later in an institutional reorganization), she expanded educational opportunities by supporting the establishment of new community college campuses in rural parts of the state. The following year she moved to Anchorage Community College (at the time a separate institution; as of 1987 part of the University of Alaska system), where she founded and helped develop the Native Student Services over a period of 17 years.Jennings & Collier (2002), p. 213-214. As an administrator she arranged the first in-depth survey of Native students, in 1983, gathering insights to improve services for them; and established the position of Native Student Coordinator, as a channel for continued student input. Under Abraham the NSS fostered collaboration and mutual support among Native students, and also developed closer ties with the Native community in Anchorage.Jennings & Collier (2002), p. 214, 216. Abraham later chaired the Board of Commissioners of the Alaska Native Science Commission, a non-profit organization founded in 1993 to support relationships between research scientists and Alaskan Native communities. \n",

The goal was to foster the integration of the knowledge triangle — higher education, research, and innovation — across the European Union. The rationale behind the establishment of the EIT was the EU’s attempt to re-launch its Lisbon Strategy, signed in 2000, focusing on a ‘growth and job’ agenda.Peter D. Jones, “The European Institute of Technology and the Europe of Knowledge: A Research Agenda”, Globalisation, Societies and Education, 6:3, 291-307, October 10, 2008, DOI: 10.1080/14767720802343357. The EIT was, therefore, an attempt to redefine the European Commission mandates and governance of higher education institutions as part of a knowledge-based economy route to economic and social development.

The topics of the first wave of KICs (climate, energy, digital) were selected based on the criteria for selection described in Article 7 (“Selection of KICs”) in December 2009. Article 7 was open to some degree of interpretation and the Governing Board working group was essential in shaping a common understanding of each potential KIC. For instance, the concept of EIT Climate-KIC was defined as climate change mitigation and adaptation; KIC InnoEnergy (now InnoEnergy) was focused on sustainable energy sources; and EIT ICT Labs (now EIT Digital) put emphasis not only on digital technology but on the future of social information sharing and communication. \n",

Scaling up was done through the pilot implementation of EIT-labelled degrees with the goal of creating role models for the kind of education it wanted to promote.“EIT Label,” European Institute of Innovation and Technology, accessed November 23, 2022, EIT Label | EIT (europa.eu). That meant hands-on entrepreneurial education that addressed topical issues such as the climate crisis, finding alternative power source solutions, and technological advances to improve people’s lives.

The SIA also set the themes for 2016 and 2018 calls to establish an additional three KICs in the themes of Food4Future (now EIT Food), added-value manufacturing (now EIT Manufacturing), and eco-friendly urban mobility (EIT Urban Mobility). During this period, the eight KIC EIT structure was established to contribute to a larger EU policy agenda and, specifically, Horizon 2020. Additionally, the RIS Scheme was introduced as an answer to underrepresentation of innovation start-ups and education for entrepreneurs in non-EU countries. The scheme seeks out and nurtures new partnerships with research and education institutions in RIS countries. Its funding mobility programmes offer students, researchers, and entrepreneurs of any age the chance to gain new skills. In 2017, the EIT expanded the total EIT RIS countries to 18.

      "Theory\n",
      " Evapoporometry uses modified forms of the Kelvin equation to relate the evaporation of a wetting liquid (usually 2-propanol) from a membrane to the average diameter of the pores in that membrane. The primary equation used in this technique is: d = -{4yV \\over RT*ln(W_A/W^\\circ_A) } Where d is the pore diameter, y is the surface tension, V_\\text{A} is the vapor molar volume, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, W_A is the instantaneous evaporation rate in mol/s, and W^\\circ_A is the average evaporation rate of the free-standing liquid layer in mol/s. thumb|right|An example schematic of an evapoporometry curve for a synthetic polymeric membrane. \n",
      "Method\n",
      " Evapoporometry has the significant advantage of requiring only a lab scale, 2-propanol (or another wetting fluid), and a cell in which to contain the sample and 2-propanol. The sample is immersed for some time in 2-propanol prior to measurement to ensure saturation of pores, and is then placed into the cell in an analytical balance and immersed again in 2-propanol, after which the change in mass due to evaporation of the free-standing liquid layer and then draining of liquid from pores is measured by the analytical balance. Instantaneous evaporation rates are calculated from the mass data and input into the above equation to yield a pore-size distribution for the sample. W^\\circ_A can be used to quantitatively determine value of W_A at which pore draining begins, which is equal to W^\\circ_A - 3\\sigma, where \\sigma is the standard deviation of W^\\circ_A. This analysis is enabled by the principle that evaporation from small pores will only occur after 2-propanol in larger pores has completely evaporated. It is important to note that there exists a nanoscale layer of wetting fluid on both the membrane and the test cell material known as the \"t-layer,\" the mass of which is to be excluded from measurement to increase accuracy, otherwise these points may be incorrectly attributed to subnanometer pores. Akhondi et al describe methods for correction of the t-layers of the test cell and membrane, as well as a correction for swelling of membranes during the experiment. The correction for the t-layer of the test cell itself can be made by performing the evapoporometry procedure as described above with an empty test cell, integrating from the start point of pore draining until the point at which d = 4 nm to yield the mass of the t-layer. This mass plus the mass of the membrane's t-layer will constitute the endpoint of pore diameter calculation for the principal evapoporometry measurement. \n",

      " In polymer science, excluded volume refers to the idea that one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule.Hill T.

The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long-chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough, and led to the explanation of several puzzling experimental results of the day. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics.Rubinstein M., Colby R. H., Polymer Physics, Oxford University Press, New York, 2003, p 49 The long-range interactions arising from excluded volume are eliminated, allowing the experimenter to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near- neighboring groups. Flory correctly identified that the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution if excluded volume interactions were neutralized by experimenting at the theta point. \n",

      "Environmental governance (EG) consist of a system of laws, norms, rules, policies and practices that dictate how the board members of an environment related regulatory body should manage and oversee the affairs of any environment related regulatory body which is responsible for ensuring sustainability (sustainable development) and manage all human activities—political, social and economic.Page 8. The Soft Path in a Nutshell. (2005). Oliver M Brandes and David B Brooks. University of Victoria, Victoria, BC. Environmental governance includes government, business and civil society, and emphasizes whole system management. To capture this diverse range of elements, environmental governance often employs alternative systems of governance, for example watershed-based management.IPlanet U, R. Michael M'Gonigle, Justine Starke It views natural resources and the environment as global public goods, belonging to the category of goods that are not diminished when they are shared.Launay, Claire, Mouriès, Thomas, Les différentes catégories de biens , summary and excerpt from Pierre Calame’s book, ’’La démocratie en miettes’’, 2003. This means that everyone benefits from, for example, a breathable atmosphere, stable climate and stable biodiversity. Public goods are non-rivalrous—a natural resource enjoyed by one person can still be enjoyed by others—and non-excludable—it is impossible to prevent someone consuming the good (such as breathing). Public goods are recognized as beneficial and therefore have value. The notion of a global public good thus emerges, with a slight distinction: it covers necessities that must not be destroyed by one person or state. The non-rivalrous character of such goods calls for a management approach that restricts public and private actors from damaging them. One approach is to attribute an economic value to the resource. Water is an example of this type of good. \n",
      "Definitions\n",
      " Environmental governance refers to the processes of decision- making involved in the control and management of the environment and natural resources. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), define environmental governance as the 'multi-level interactions (i.e., local, national, international/global) among, but not limited to, three main actors, i.e., state, market, and civil society, which interact with one another, whether in formal and informal ways; in formulating and implementing policies in response to environment-related demands and inputs from the society; bound by rules, procedures, processes, and widely accepted behavior; possessing characteristics of “good governance”; for the purpose of attaining environmentally-sustainable development' (IUCN 2014) Key principles of environmental governance include: * Embedding the environment in all levels of decision-making and action * Conceptualizing cities and communities, economic and political life as a subset of the environment * Emphasizing the connection of people to the ecosystems in which they live * Promoting the transition from open-loop/cradle-to-grave systems (like garbage disposal with no recycling) to closed-loop/cradle-to-cradle systems (like permaculture and zero waste strategies). Neoliberal environmental governance is an approach to the theory of environmental governance framed by a perspective on neoliberalism as an ideology, policy and practice in relation to the biophysical world. There are many definitions and applications of neoliberalism, e.g. in economic, international relations, etc. However, the traditional understanding of neoliberalism is often simplified to the notion of the primacy of market-led economics through the rolling back of the state, deregulation and privatisation. Neoliberalism has evolved particularly over the last 40 years with many scholars leaving their ideological footprint on the neoliberal map. Hayek and Friedman believed in the superiority of the free market over state intervention. As long as the market was allowed to act freely, the supply/demand law would ensure the ‘optimal’ price and reward. In Karl Polanyi’s opposing view this would also create a state of tension in which self-regulating free markets disrupt and alter social interactions and “displace other valued means of living and working”.Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p. 281. However, in contrast to the notion of an unregulated market economy there has also been a “paradoxical increase in [state] intervention” in the choice of economic, legislative and social policy reforms, which are pursued by the state to preserve the neoliberal order. This contradictory process is described by Peck and Tickell as roll back/roll out neoliberalism in which on one hand the state willingly gives up the control over resources and responsibility for social provision while on the other, it engages in “purposeful construction and consolidation of neoliberalised state forms, modes of governance, and regulatory relations\". There has been a growing interest in the effects of neoliberalism on the politics of the non-human world of environmental governance. Neoliberalism is seen to be more than a homogenous and monolithic ‘thing’ with a clear end point. It is a series of path-dependent, spatially and temporally “connected neoliberalisation” processes which affect and are affected by nature and environment that “cover a remarkable array of places, regions and countries”.Castree, N. (2007) ‘Neoliberal ecologies’, in Nik Heynen, James McCarthy, Scott Prudham and Paul Robbins (eds.) Neoliberal environments, London: Routledge, p. 283. Co-opting neoliberal ideas of the importance of private property and the protection of individual (investor) rights, into environmental governance can be seen in the example of recent multilateral trade agreements (see in particular the North American Free Trade Agreement). Such neoliberal structures further reinforce a process of nature enclosure and primitive accumulation or “accumulation by dispossession” that serves to privatise increasing areas of nature. The ownership-transfer of resources traditionally not privately owned to free market mechanisms is believed to deliver greater efficiency and optimal return on investment. Other similar examples of neo-liberal inspired projects include the enclosure of minerals, the fisheries quota system in the North Pacific and the privatisation of water supply and sewage treatment in England and Wales.Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press All three examples share neoliberal characteristics to “deploy markets as the solution to environmental problems” in which scarce natural resources are commercialized and turned into commodities.Bakker, K. (2004) An uncooperative commodity: privatizing water in England and Wales, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.431 The approach to frame the ecosystem in the context of a price-able commodity is also present in the work of neoliberal geographers who subject nature to price and supply/demand mechanisms where the earth is considered to be a quantifiable resource (Costanza, for example, estimates the earth ecosystem's service value to be between 16 and 54 trillion dollars per year). \n",

      "Main drivers of environmental degradation\n",
      " Economic growth – The development-centric vision that prevails in most countries and international institutions advocates a headlong rush towards more economic growth. Environmental economists on the other hand, point to a close correlation between economic growth and environmental degradation, arguing for qualitative development as an alternative to growth. As a result, the past couple of decades has seen a big shift towards sustainable development as an alternative to neo-liberal economics. There are those, particularly within the alternative globalization movement, who maintain that it is feasible to change to a degrowth phase without losing social efficiency or lowering the quality of life. Consumption – The growth of consumption and the cult of consumption, or consumerist ideology, is the major cause of economic growth. Overdevelopment, seen as the only alternative to poverty, has become an end in itself. The means for curbing this growth are not equal to the task, since the phenomenon is not confined to a growing middle class in developing countries, but also concerns the development of irresponsible lifestyles, particularly in northern countries, such as the increase in the size and number of homes and cars per person. Destruction of biodiversity – The complexity of the planet's ecosystems means that the loss of any species has unexpected consequences. The stronger the impact on biodiversity, the stronger the likelihood of a chain reaction with unpredictable negative effects. Another important factor of environmental degradation that falls under this destruction of biodiversity, and must not be ignored is deforestation. Despite all the damage inflicted, a number of ecosystems have proved to be resilient. Environmentalists are endorsing a precautionary principle whereby all potentially damaging activities would have to be analyzed for their environmental impact. Population growth – Forecasts predict 8.9 billion people on the planet in 2050. This is a subject which primarily affects developing countries, but also concerns northern countries; although their demographic growth is lower, the environmental impact per person is far higher in these countries. Demographic growth needs to be countered by developing education and family planning programs and generally improving women's status. \"Pollution\" - Pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels is another driver of environmental destruction. The burning of carbon-based fossil fuels such as coal and oil, releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One of the major impacts of this is the climate change that is currently taking place on the planet, where the earth's temperature is gradually rising. Given that fuels such as coal and oil are the most heavily used fuels, this a great concern to many environmentalists. \"Agricultural practices\" - Destructive agricultural practices such as overuse of fertilizers and overgrazing lead to land degradation. The soil gets eroded, and leads to silting in rivers and reservoirs. Soil erosion is a continuous cycle and ultimately results in desertification of the land. Apart from land degradation, water pollution is also a possibility; chemicals used in farming can run-off into rivers and contaminate the water. \n",
      "Challenges\n",
      " Challenges facing environmental governance include: * Inadequate continental and global agreements * Unresolved tensions between maximum development, sustainable development and maximum protection, limiting funding, damaging links with the economy and limiting application of Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs). * Environmental funding is not self-sustaining, diverting resources from problem-solving into funding battles. * Lack of integration of sector policies * Inadequate institutional capacities * Ill-defined priorities * Unclear objectives * Lack of coordination within the UN, governments, the private sector and civil society * Lack of shared vision * Interdependencies among development/sustainable economic growth, trade, agriculture, health, peace and security. * International imbalance between environmental governance and trade and finance programs, e.g., World Trade Organization (WTO). * Limited credit for organizations running projects within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) * Linking UNEP, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank with MEAs * Lack of government capacity to satisfy MEA obligations * Absence of the gender perspective and equity in environmental governance * Inability to influence public opinionGlobal Conventions and Environmental Governance; Inforesources Focus No. 3, 2005.UNEP; International Environmental Governance and the Reform of the United Nations, XVI Meeting of the Forum of Environment Ministers of Latin America and the Caribbean; 2008.Civil Society Statement on International Environmental Governance; Seventh special session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF; Cartagena, Colombia; February 2002. * Time lag between human action and environmental effect, sometimes as long as a generation * Environmental problems being embedded in very complex systems, of which our understanding is still quite weak All of these challenges have implications on governance, however international environmental governance is necessary. The IDDRI claims that rejection of multilateralism in the name of efficiency and protection of national interests conflicts with the promotion of international law and the concept of global public goods. Others cite the complex nature of environmental problems. On the other hand, The Agenda 21 program has been implemented in over 7,000 communities.7,000 municipalities is very few, in view of the fact that over a million municipalities exist on the planet and that initial forecasts were for local agenda 21 actions being adopted in 500,000 municipalities in 1996 and throughout the rest of the planet in 2000 Environmental problems, including global-scale problems, may not always require global solutions. For example, marine pollution can be tackled regionally, and ecosystem deterioration can be addressed locally. Other global problems such as climate change benefit from local and regional action. Bäckstrand and Saward wrote, “sustainability and environmental protection is an arena in which innovative experiments with new hybrid, plurilateral forms of governance, along with the incorporation of a transnational civil society spanning the public-private divide, are taking place.”Bäckstrand, Karin; Saward, Michel; Democratizing Global Governance: Stakeholder Democracy at the World Summit for Sustainable Development; Document presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association; Chicago; 2005. \n",
      "Local governance\n",
      " A 1997 report observed a global consensus that sustainable development implementation should be based on local level solutions and initiatives designed with and by the local communities.Leach, M., Mearns, R and Scoones, I. (1997), Challenges to community based sustainable development, in IDS Bulletin Vol 28:4, pp 1 Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental governance at the local level. Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was “driven by state agendas and resource control” and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that local level governance encompasses. The adoption of practices or interventions at a local scale can, in part, be explained by diffusion of innovation theory. In Tanzania and in the Pacific, researchers have illustrated that aspects of the intervention, of the adopter, and of the social-ecological context all shape why community- centered conservation interventions spread through space and time. Local level governance shifts decision-making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. Local level governance is extremely important even on a global scale. Environmental governance at the global level is defined as international and as such has resulted in the marginalisation of local voices. Local level governance is important to bring back power to local communities in the global fight against environmental degridation.Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 57 Pulgar Vidal observed a “new institutional framework, [wherein] decision-making regarding access to and use of natural resources has become increasingly decentralized.” He noted four techniques that can be used to develop these processes: * formal and informal regulations, procedures and processes, such as consultations and participative democracy; * social interaction that can arise from participation in development programs or from the reaction to perceived injustice; * regulating social behaviours to reclassify an individual question as a public matter; * within-group participation in decision-making and relations with external actors. He found that the key conditions for developing decentralized environmental governance are: * access to social capital, including local knowledge, leaders and local shared vision; * democratic access to information and decision-making; * local government activity in environmental governance: as facilitator of access to natural resources, or as policy maker; * an institutional framework that favours decentralized environmental governance and creates forums for social interaction and making widely accepted agreements acceptable. The legitimacy of decisions depends on the local population's participation rate and on how well participants represent that population. With regard to public authorities, questions linked to biodiversity can be faced by adopting appropriate policies and strategies, through exchange of knowledge and experience, the forming of partnerships, correct management of land use, monitoring of biodiversity and optimal use of resources, or reducing consumption, and promoting environmental certifications, such as EMAS and/or ISO 14001. Local authorities undoubtedly have a central role to play in the protection of biodiversity and this strategy is successful above all when the authorities show strength by involving stakeholders in a credible environmental improvement project and activating a transparent and effective communication policy (Ioppolo et al., 2013). \n",
      "State governance\n",
      " States play a crucial role in environmental governance, because \"however far and fast international economic integration proceeds, political authority remains vested in national governments\".Cable, V. 1999, Globalisation and global governance, Chatham House Papers, London It is for this reason that governments should respect and support the commitment to implementation of international agreements.WHAT 2000, \"Governance for a sustainable future\", Reports of the Commissions of the World Humanity Action Trust, viewed 22 April 2014, http://www.stakeholderforum.org/policy/governance/future.pdf At the state level, environmental management has been found to be conducive to the creation of roundtables and committees. In France, the Grenelle de l’environnementOperational Committee No. 24 \"Institutions and stakeholder representativity\" (introduced by Bertrand Pancher); Final report to the Prime Minister, senior Minister, Minister for the Ecology, Sustainable Development and Territorial Planning; 2008, also known as the Rapport Pancher. process: * included a variety of actors (e.g. the state, political leaders, unions, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and environmental protection foundations); * allowed stakeholders to interact with the legislative and executive powers in office as indispensable advisors; * worked to integrate other institutions, particularly the Economic and Social Council, to form a pressure group that participated in the process for creating an environmental governance model; * attempted to link with environmental management at regional and local levels. If environmental issues are excluded from e.g., the economic agenda, this may delegitimize those institutions.Laime, Marc; Gouvernance environnementale: vers une meilleure concertation ? (Environmental Governance: towards better consultation?); 2008. “In southern countries, the main obstacle to the integration of intermediate levels in the process of territorial environmental governance development is often the dominance of developmentalist inertia in states’ political mindset. The question of the environment has not been effectively integrated in national development planning and programs. Instead, the most common idea is that environmental protection curbs economic and social development, an idea encouraged by the frenzy for exporting raw materials extracted using destructive methods that consume resources and fail to generate any added value.”IUCN; Gobernanza ambiental para un desarrollo sostenible (Environmental Governance for Sustainable Development). Of course they are justified in this thinking, as their main concerns are social injustices such as poverty alleviation. Citizens in some of these states have responded by developing empowerment strategies to ease poverty through sustainable development. In addition to this, policymakers must be more aware of these concerns of the global south, and must make sure to integrate a strong focus on social justice in their policies. \n",
      " Global governance \n",
      " According to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, global environmental governance is \"the sum of organizations, policy instruments, financing mechanisms, rules, procedures and norms that regulate the processes of global environmental protection.\" At the global level there are numerous important actors involved in environmental governance and \"a range of institutions contribute to and help define the practice of global environmental governance. The idea of global environmental governance is to govern the environment at a global level through a range of nation states and non state actors such as national governments, NGOs and other international organisations such as UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme). The global environmental movement can be traced back to the 19th century; academics acknowledge the role of the United Nations for providing a platform for international conversations regarding the environment. Supporters of global environmental governance emphasize the importance of international cooperation on environmental issues such as climate change. Some opponents argue that more aggressive regional environmental governance has a stronger impact compared to global environmental governance. Global environmental governance is the answer to calls for new forms of governance because of the increasing complexity of the international agenda. It is perceived to be an effective form of multilateral management and essential to the international community in meeting goals of mitigation and the possible reversal of the impacts on the global environment.Elliot, L. (1956), Global Environmental Governance, in Hughes, S. and Wilkinson, R. (eds), Global Governance: Critical Perspectives, London: Routledge, ch. 4, pp. 58 However, a precise definition of global environmental governance is still vague and there are many issues surrounding global governance. Elliot argues that “the congested institutional terrain still provides more of an appearance than a reality of comprehensive global governance.” It is a political practice which simultaneously reflects, constitutes and masks global relations of power and powerlessness.” State agendas exploit the use of global environmental governance to enhance their oven agendas or wishes even if this is at the detriment of the vital element behind global environmental governance which is the environment. Elliot states that global environmental governance “is neither normatively neutral nor materially benign.” As explored by Newell, report notes by The Global Environmental Outlook noted that the systems of global environmental governance are becoming increasingly irrelevant or impotent due to patterns of globalisation such as; imbalances in productivity and the distribution of goods and services, unsustainable progression of extremes of wealth and poverty and population and economic growth overtaking environmental gains. Newell states that, despite such acknowledgements, the “managing of global environmental change within International Relations continues to look to international regimes for the answers.” \n",
      "= Environmental Governance in the Global North and Global South \n",
      "= Relations between the Global North and Global South have been impacted by a history of colonialism, during which Northern colonial powers contributed to environmental degradation of natural resources in the South. This dynamic continues to influence international relations and is the basis for what some historians recognize as the \"North- South divide.\" Scholars argue that this divide has created hurdles in the international lawmaking process regarding the environment. Scholars have noted that unindustrialized countries in the Global South sometimes are disconnected from environmentalism and perceive environmental governance to be a \"luxury\" priority for the Global North. In recent years, sustainable development has made its way to the forefront of international discourse and urges the North and South to cooperate. Academics recognized that environmental governance priorities in the Global North have been at odds with the desire to focus on economic development in the Global South. Some analysts propose a shift towards \"non-state\" actors for the development of environmental governance. Environmental politics researcher Karin Bäckstrand claims this will increase transparency, accountability, and legitimacy. In some cases, scholars have noted that environmental governance in the Global North has had adverse consequences on the environment in the Global South. Environmental and economic priorities in the Global North do not always align with those in the Global South. Producers in the Global North developed voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) to address environmental concerns in the North, but these standards also end up impacting economic activity in the Global South. Jeffrey J. Minneti from the William & Mary Law School has argued that the Global South needs to \"manage its own ecological footprint\" by creating VSS independent from the Global North. Tension between countries in the Global North and Global South has caused some academics to criticize global environmental governance for being too slow of a process to enact policy change. \n",
      " Outer Space Environmental Governance \n",
      " Since space travel and activities began in the 1950s, more nations have engaged in the race to use space more rigorously. More specifically, USA and Russia launched the world's first artificial satellite. The other new nations entering the space race lack the comprehensive space abilities similar to the US and Russia. The need and desire to expand into space creates numerous problems, none more prominent than the concern of space wreckages. Various organizations, including the Committee of Space Research, continue to implement ways to successfully and effectively govern the global sphere. Laws like the Planetary Protection Policy are meant to regulate the use of space, specifically, the issue of space debris. As each launch becomes more and more dangerous, the policy development of various countries is unbalanced, and there is a lack of unified international standards and norms. Space is at risk of permanent damage or \"Kessler syndrome\" (an on-orbit collision chain reaction caused by major debris events). It increases the risk of paralyzed global space services, including GPS, the global financial system, and daily weather forecasts. Although the Planetary Protection Policy law is not enforceable, it helps protect against the Moon's contamination and other celestial bodies. The space governing organizations implement laws that help regulate space use, thus, lessening space contamination. For instance, the 65% post-mission-disposal still falls well short of the 90% target, which China looks to increase to 95%. However, more countries are implementing additional measures to increase that number. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is important because it monitors the conditions in space and helps improve Safety-of-Flight (SoF), increasing its comprehensiveness, timeliness, accuracy, and transparency. Outer space is part of the environment because it is linked to the Earth's environment in numerous modest ways. For instance, the day-to-day changes in the weather system are closely related to outer space conditions. The solar wind repeatedly hits Earth's magnetic field, including its upper atmosphere, resulting in Earth's electrical properties. Furthermore, Earth sits at the center of the 'gale' of particles that emanate from the outer parts of the Sun's atmosphere. Like the solar wind but of much deeper space origin, cosmic rays also strike the Earth penetrating its lower atmosphere, where it is believed to help form low-level clouds. Lastly, outer space is part of the environment because its conditions affect the operations of spaceships, the health of astronauts, and the state and functioning of any other objects and satellites circumnavigating Earth. The international space order is amid an upheaval, adjustment, and reconstruction period. The global space economy will be worth $360 billion by 2018. However, as costs decline, it is expected that the entry barrier to space will continue to decrease. Countries are increasingly focusing their attention on space not only for national security but also for commercial opportunities. As a result, outer space environmental governance is being introduced gradually. The space governance methods incorporate the issues provided in the Montreal Declaration, which requires the following elements. The inspection of the shifting international fiscal, social, and political environments and space infrastructure dependence; the identification and valuation of all known space threats and dangers; the inspection of all space prospects and the need for maintainable and diplomatic use of outer space, including the study and manipulation of space for the advantage of man; the recognition of safety, technical, and operative alterations requiring resolutions; and the endorsement of relevant space governance treaties, arrangements, guidelines, ethics, and apposite established mechanisms, inventions and procedures pertinent to existing and developing space events. Many countries aspire to be leaders and responsible actors in space and therefore support the international community's ongoing efforts to develop responsible behavior and norms for space operators. Countries such as Brazil, China, France, Japan, and South Africa are all working to establish standards of behavior in space, hoping to protect space assets through better space situational awareness and space traffic management. Below are examples of policies from three different countries. * Australia does not have a national space policy but emphasizes COPUOS standards for space debris mitigation while creating official guidelines for international launches. Australia has activated a C-band space surveillance radar system for the purpose of tracking space debris. These data from the southern hemisphere will help increase worldwide awareness of the state of the world's space and sustainable practices. * France's outer space environmental governance policy is mostly seen in the 2011 Technical Regulations Decree, which focuses on launch and orbital licensing. The Technical Regulations Decree requires that rail systems be designed, manufactured, and implemented in such a way that debris is avoided during regular operation. At launch, the likelihood of disintegration in orbit must be less than one in 1,000. Additionally, it must be capable of safely deorbiting and re-entering the atmosphere once the mission is accomplished. If it cannot deorbit, it must adhere to the ITU's standards for geosynchronous orbits. * Canada's government has established a regulatory framework aimed at reducing the formation of space debris. Operators must give an evaluation and plan for disposing of projected orbital debris. The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) has adopted the IADC principles for space debris mitigation and aims to implement them across all CSA activities. Additionally, the Canadian government requires licensees of spacecraft that operate in the radio frequency to submit a space debris mitigation strategy as part of the licensing process. Simultaneously, if the satellite is in a geosynchronous orbit, it must adhere to ITU standards. \n",

      " \n",
      "= Multi-tier governance \n",
      "= The literature on governance scale shows how changes in the understanding of environmental issues have led to the movement from a local view to recognising their larger and more complicated scale. This move brought an increase in the diversity, specificity and complexity of initiatives. Meadowcroft pointed out innovations that were layered on top of existing structures and processes, instead of replacing them. Lafferty and Meadowcroft give three examples of multi-tiered governance: internationalisation, increasingly comprehensive approaches, and involvement of multiple governmental entities. Lafferty and Meadowcroft described the resulting multi-tiered system as addressing issues on both smaller and wider scales. \n",
      "= Institutional fit \n",
      "= Hans Bruyninckx claimed that a mismatch between the scale of the environmental problem and the level of the policy intervention was problematic. Young claimed that such mismatches reduced the effectiveness of interventions. Most of the literature addresses the level of governance rather than ecological scale. Elinor Ostrom, amongst others, claimed that the mismatch is often the cause of unsustainable management practices and that simple solutions to the mismatch have not been identified. Considerable debate has addressed the question of which level(s) should take responsibility for fresh water management. Development workers tend to address the problem at the local level. National governments focus on policy issues. This can create conflicts among states because rivers cross borders, leading to efforts to evolve governance of river basins. \n",

      "Climate change\n",
      " The scientific consensus on climate change is expressed in the reports of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and also in the statements by all major scientific bodies in the United States such as National Academy of Sciences. The drivers of climate change can include \\- Changes in solar irradiance \\- Changes in atmospheric trace gas and aerosol concentrations Evidence of climate change can be identified by examining \\- Atmospheric concentrations of Green House Gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide () \\- Land and sea surface temperatures \\- Atmospheric water vapor \\- Precipitation \\- The occurrence or strength of extreme weather and climate events \\- Glaciers \\- Rapid sea ice loss \\- Sea levelhttp://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter01_FINAL.pdf It is suggested by climate models that the changes in temperature and sea level can be the causal effects of human activities such as consumption of fossil fuels, deforestation, increased agricultural production and production of xenobiotic gases. There has been increasing actions in order to mitigate climate change and reduce its impact at national, regional and international levels. Kyoto protocol and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) plays the most important role in addressing climate change at an international level. The goal of combating climate change led to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol by 191 states, an agreement encouraging the reduction of greenhouse gases, mainly . Since developed economies produce more emissions per capita, limiting emissions in all countries inhibits opportunities for emerging economies, the only major success in efforts to produce a global response to the phenomenon. Two decades following the Brundtland Report, however, there has been no improvement in the key indicators highlighted. \n",
      "Biodiversity\n",
      " Environmental governance for protecting the biodiversity has to act in many levels. Biodiversity is fragile because it is threatened by almost all human actions. To promote conservation of biodiversity, agreements and laws have to be created to regulate agricultural activities, urban growth, industrialization of countries, use of natural resources, control of invasive species, the correct use of water and protection of air quality. Before making any decision for a region or country decision makers, politicians and community have to take into account what are the potential impacts for biodiversity, that any project can have. Population growth and urbanization have been a great contributor for deforestation. Also, population growth requires more intense agricultural areas use, which also results in necessity of new areas to be deforested. This causes habitat loss, which is one of the major threats for biodiversity. Habitat loss and habitat fragmentation affects all species, because they all rely on limited resources, to feed on and to breed. ‘Species are genetically unique and irreplaceable their loss is irreversible. Ecosystems vary across a vast range of parameters, and similar ecosystems (whether wetlands, forests, coastal reserves etc) cannot be presumed to be interchangeable, such that the loss of one can be compensated by protection or restoration of another’.IUCN 2010 ‘Environmental Governance’ viewed 28 May 2014, www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/environmental_law/elp_work/elp_work_issues/elp_work_governance To avoid habitat loss, and consequently biodiversity loss, politicians and lawmakers should be aware of the precautionary principle, which means that before approving a project or law all the pros and cons should be carefully analysed. Sometimes the impacts are not explicit, or not even proved to exist. However, if there is any chance of an irreversible impact happen, it should be taken into consideration.IUCN 2007 ‘Guidelines for applying the precautionary principle to biodiversity conservation and natural resource management’ viewed 28 May 2014, cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ln250507_ppguidelines.pdf To promote environmental governance for biodiversity protection there has to be a clear articulation between values and interests while negotiating environmental management plans. International agreements are good way to have it done right. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 human activities. The CBD's objectives are: “to conserve biological diversity, to use biological diversity in a sustainable fashion, to share the benefits of biological diversity fairly and equitably.” The convention is the first global agreement to address all aspects of biodiversity: genetic resources, species and ecosystems. It recognizes, for the first time, that the conservation of biological diversity is “a common concern for all humanity”. The Convention encourages joint efforts on measures for scientific and technological cooperation, access to genetic resources and the transfer of clean environmental technologies. The Convention on Biological Diversity most important edition happened in 2010 when the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Targets, were launched. These two projects together make the United Nations decade on Biodiversity. It was held in Japan and has the targets of ‘halting and eventually reversing the loss of biodiversity of the planet’.Convention on Biodiversity 2010 ‘Strategic Goals & Targets for 2020’ viewed 28 May 2014, www.cbd.int/2011-2020/goals/ The Strategic Plan for Biodiversity has the goal to ‘promote its overall vision of living in harmony with nature’ As result (...) ‘mainstream biodiversity at different levels. Throughout the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity, governments are encouraged to develop, implement and communicate the results of national strategies for implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity’. According to the CBD the five Aichi targets are: #‘Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society; #Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use; #Improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity; #Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services; #Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building.’ \n",
      " Water \n",
      " The 2003 UN World Water Development Report claimed that the amount of water available over the next twenty years would drop by 30%. In the same report, it is indicated that in 1998, 2.2 million people died from diarrhoeal diseases.United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (2003). World Water Development Report 1: \"Water for People, Water for Life\". Retrieved from: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001297/129726e.pdf#page=27 In 2004, the UK's WaterAid charity reported that one child died every 15 seconds from water-linked diseases. According to Alliance 21Proposals Related to the Water Issue “All levels of water supply management are necessary and independent. The integrated approach to the catchment areas must take into account the needs of irrigation and those of towns, jointly and not separately as is often seen to be the case....The governance of a water supply must be guided by the principles of sustainable development.” Australian water resources have always been variable but they are becoming increasingly so with changing climate conditions. Because of how limited water resources are in Australia, there needs to be an effective implementation of environmental governance conducted within the country. Water restrictions are an important policy device used in Australian environmental governance to limit the amount of water used in urban and agricultural environments (Beeton et al. 2006). There is increased pressure on surface water resources in Australia because of the uncontrolled growth in groundwater use and the constant threat of drought. These increased pressures not only affect the quantity and quality of the waterways but they also negatively affect biodiversity. The government needs to create policies that preserve, protect and monitor Australia's inland water. The most significant environmental governance policy imposed by the Australian government is environmental flow allocations that allocate water to the natural environment. The proper implementation of water trading systems could help to conserve water resources in Australia. Over the years there has been an increase in demand for water, making Australia the third largest per capita user of water in the world (Beeton et al. 2006). If this trend continues, the gap between supply and demand will need to be addressed. The government needs to implement more efficient water allocations and raise water rates (UNEP, 2014). By changing public perception to promote the action of reusing and recycling water some of the stress of water shortages can be alleviated. More extensive solutions like desalination plants, building more dams and using aquifer storage are all options that could be taken to conserve water levels but all these methods are controversial. With caps on surface water use, both urban and rural consumers are turning to groundwater use; this has caused groundwater levels to decline significantly. Groundwater use is very hard to monitor and regulate. There is not enough research currently being conducted to accurately determine sustainable yields. Some regions are seeing improvement in groundwater levels by applying caps on bores and the amount of water that consumers are allowed to extract. There have been projects in environmental governance aimed at restoring vegetation in the riparian zone. Restoring riparian vegetation helps increase biodiversity, reduce salinity, prevent soil erosion and prevent riverbank collapse. Many rivers and waterways are controlled by weirs and locks that control the flow of rivers and also prevent the movement of fish. The government has funded fish-ways on some weirs and locks to allow for native fish to move upstream. Wetlands have significantly suffered under restricted water resources with water bird numbers dropping and a decrease in species diversity. The allocation of water for bird breeding through environmental flows in Macquarie Marshes has led to an increase in breeding (Beeton et al. 2006). Because of dry land salinity throughout Australia there has been an increase in the levels of salt in Australian waterways. There has been funding in salt interception schemes which help to improve in-stream salinity levels but whether river salinity has improved or not is still unclear because there is not enough data available yet. High salinity levels are dangerous because they can negatively affect larval and juvenile stages of certain fish. The introduction of invasive species into waterways has negatively affected native aquatic species because invasive species compete with native species and alter natural habitats. There has been research in producing daughterless carp to help eradicate carp. Government funding has also gone into building in-stream barriers that trap the carp and prevent them from moving into floodplains and wetlands. Investment in national and regional programmes like the Living Murray (MDBC), Healthy Waterways Partnership and the Clean Up the Swan Programme are leading to important environmental governance. The Healthy Rivers programme promotes restoration and recovery of environmental flows, riparian re-vegetation and aquatic pest control. The Living Murray programme has been crucial for the allocation of water to the environment by creating an agreement to recover 500 billion litres of water to the Murray River environment. Environmental governance and water resource management in Australia must be constantly monitored and adapted to suit the changing environmental conditions within the country (Beeton et al. 2006). If environmental programmes are governed with transparency there can be a reduction in policy fragmentation and an increase in policy efficiency (Mclntyre, 2010). In Arab countries, the extensive use of water for agriculture also needs critical attention since agriculture in this region has less contribution for its national income.

      " Precautionary principle \n",
      " The precautionary principle or precautionary approach states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is harmful, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action. As of 2013 it was not the basis of major multilateral agreements. The Precautionary Principle is put into effect if there is a chance that proposed action may cause harm to the society or the environment. Therefore, those involved in the proposed action must provide evidence that it will not be harmful, even if scientists do not believe that it will cause harm. It falls upon the policymakers to make the optimal decision, if there is any risk, even without any credible scientific evidence. However, taking precautionary action also means that there is an element of cost involved, either social or economic. So if the cost was seen as insignificant the action would be taken without the implementation of the precautionary principle.Goldstein, BD 2000, 'Applying the precautionary principle to the environment', Bulletin Of The World Health Organization, 78, 9, p. 1159, Health Business Elite, EBSCOhost, viewed 17 May 2014. But often the cost is ignored, which can lead to harmful repercussions. This is often the case with industry and scientists who are primarily concerned with protecting their own interests.European Report 25 Jan. 2013\"ENVIRONMENT : PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE: EEA REPORT DAMNING TO INDUSTRY.\"Academic OneFile.

      " Environmental issues such as natural resource management and climate change have security and social considerations. Drinking water scarcity and climate change can cause mass migrations of climate refugees, for example. Social network analysis has been applied to understand how different actors cooperate and conflict in environmental governance. Existing relationships can influence how stakeholders collaborate during times of conflict: a study of transportation planning and land use in California found that stakeholders choose their collaborative partners by avoiding those with the most dissimilar beliefs, rather than by selecting for those with shared views. The result is known as homophily--actors with similar views are more likely to end up collaborating than those with opposing views. \n",

Among these is the last stage of a rocket, functioning pieces of starting explosive devices, disintegration fragments created by the mutual impact of space vehicles or arrows (projectiles) as a result of their explosion. In the vicinity of the Earth, there are already more than 50,000 abandoned spacecraft and space junk as each launch gets hazardous. A \"Kessler syndrome\" or \"permanent harm\" might occur, which means one fragment breaks up and collides with another fragment, causing a series of collisions, which eventually pollutes the whole orbit of the satellite. Space has become a part of daily human life, from telecommunications to disaster monitoring.

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) (1992–1994): aims to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would stabilize the climate system without threatening food production, and enabling the pursuit of sustainable economic development; it incorporates the Kyoto Protocol. United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) (1994–1996): aims to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought and desertification, in developing countries (Though initially the convention was primarily meant for Africa). Further conventions: * Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (1971–1975) * UNESCO World Heritage Convention (1972–1975) * Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) (1973–1975) * Bonn Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (1979–1983) * Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) (1992–1996) * Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (1989–1992) * Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedures for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade * Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (COP) (2001–2004) The Rio Conventions are characterized by: * obligatory execution by signatory states * involvement in a sector of global environmental governance * focus on the fighting poverty and the development of sustainable living conditions; * funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for countries with few financial resources; * inclusion of a for assessing ecosystem statusMillennium assessment Environmental conventions are regularly criticized for their: * rigidity and verticality: they are too descriptive, homogenous and top down, not reflecting the diversity and complexity of environmental issues. Signatory countries struggle to translate objectives into concrete form and incorporate them consistently; * duplicate structures and aid: the sector-specific format of the conventions produced duplicate structures and procedures. Inadequate cooperation between government ministries; * contradictions and incompatibility: e.g., “if reforestation projects to reduce give preference to monocultures of exotic species, this can have a negative impact on biodiversity (whereas natural regeneration can strengthen both biodiversity and the conditions needed for life).” Until now, the formulation of environmental policies at the international level has been divided by theme, sector or territory, resulting in treaties that overlap or clash. International attempts to coordinate environment institutions, include the Inter-Agency Coordination Committee and the Commission for Sustainable Development, but these institutions are not powerful enough to effectively incorporate the three aspects of sustainable development. \n",

Further agreements cover regional environmental problems, such as deforestation in Borneo or pollution in the Mediterranean. Each agreement has a specific mission and objectives ratified by multiple states. Many Multilateral Environmental Agreements have been negotiated with the support from the United Nations Environmental Programme and work towards the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals as a means to instil sustainable practices for the environment and its people.Steiner, A & Oviir, M (2010) ‘Auditing the Implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs): A Primer for Auditors’, United Nations Environment Programme, pp. 1-136 Multilateral Environmental Agreements are considered to present enormous opportunities for greener societies and economies which can deliver numerous benefits in addressing food, energy and water security and in achieving sustainable development. These agreements can be implemented on a global or regional scale, for example the issues surrounding the disposal of hazardous waste can be implemented on a regional level as per the Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Waste within Africa which applies specifically to Africa, or the global approach to hazardous waste such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal which is monitored throughout the world.African Union, (2010) ‘Bamako Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes within Africa’, African Union, accessed on 16 May 2014 via Basil Action Network (2011) ‘The Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal’, Basil Action Network, accessed on 16 May 2014 via “The environmental governance structure defined by the Rio and Johannesburg Summits is sustained by UNEP, MEAs and developmental organizations and consists of assessment and policy development, as well as project implementation at the country level. \"The governance structure consists of a chain of phases: * a) assessment of environment status; * b) international policy development; * c) formulation of MEAs; * d) policy implementation; * e) policy assessment; * f) enforcement; * g) sustainable development. \"Traditionally, UNEP has focused on the normative role of engagement in the first three phases. Phases (d) to (f) are covered by MEAs and the sustainable development phase involves developmental organizations such as UNDP and the World Bank.” Lack of coordination affects the development of coherent governance. The report shows that donor states support development organizations, according to their individual interests. They do not follow a joint plan, resulting in overlaps and duplication. MEAs tend not to become a joint frame of reference and therefore receive little financial support. States and organizations emphasize existing regulations rather than improving and adapting them. \n",
      "Background\n",
      " The risks associated with nuclear fission raised global awareness of environmental threats. The 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty prohibiting atmospheric nuclear testing was the beginning of the globalization of environmental issues. Environmental law began to be modernized and coordinated with the Stockholm Conference (1972), backed up in 1980 by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.Di Mento, Josep; The Global Environment and International law, University of Texas Press; 2003; p 7. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was signed and ratified in 1985. In 1987, 24 countries signed the Montreal Protocol which imposed the gradual withdrawal of CFCs. The Brundtland Report, published in 1987 by the UN Commission on Environment and Development, stipulated the need for economic development that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the capacity of future generations to meet their needs. \n",
      "Rio Conference (1992) and reactions\n",
      " The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), better known as the 1992 Earth Summit, was the first major international meeting since the end of the Cold War and was attended by delegations from 175 countries. Since then the biggest international conferences that take place every 10 years guided the global governance process with a series of MEAs. Environmental treaties are applied with the help of secretariats. Governments created international treaties in the 1990s to check global threats to the environment. These treaties are far more restrictive than global protocols and set out to change non-sustainable production and consumption models.Bouguerra, Larbi; La consommation assassine.

      "Agenda 21\n",
      " Agenda 21 is a detailed plan of actions to be implemented at the global, national and local levels by UN organizations, member states and key individual groups in all regions. Agenda 21 advocates making sustainable development a legal principle law. At the local level, local Agenda 21 advocates an inclusive, territory- based strategic plan, incorporating sustainable environmental and social policies. The Agenda has been accused of using neoliberal principles, including free trade to achieve environmental goals. For example, chapter two, entitled “International Cooperation to Accelerate Sustainable Development in Developing Countries and Related Domestic Policies” states, “The international economy should provide a supportive international climate for achieving environment and development goals by: promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization.” \n",

      "=United Nations Environment Program\n",
      "= The UNEP has had its biggest impact as a monitoring and advisory body, and in developing environmental agreements. It has also contributed to strengthening the institutional capacity of environment ministries. In 2002 UNEP held a conference to focus on product lifecycle impacts, emphasizing the fashion, advertising, financial and retail industries, seen as key agents in promoting sustainable consumption. According to Ivanova, UNEP adds value in environmental monitoring, scientific assessment and information sharing, but cannot lead all environmental management processes. She proposed the following tasks for UNEP: * initiate a strategic independent overhaul of its mission; * consolidate the financial information and transparency process; * restructure organizing governance by creating an operative executive council that balances the omnipresence of the overly imposing and fairly ineffectual Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum (GMEF). Other proposals offer a new mandate to “produce greater unity amongst social and environmental agencies, so that the concept of ‘environment for development’ becomes a reality. It needs to act as a platform for establishing standards and for other types of interaction with national and international organizations and the United Nations. The principles of cooperation and common but differentiated responsibilities should be reflected in the application of this revised mandate.”Reforming International Environmental Governance: Statement representing views expressed at two meetings of stakeholders held at the 24th Session of the UNEP Governing Council/GMEF 2007. Sherman proposed principles to strengthen UNEP: * obtain a social consensus on a long-term vision; * analyze the current situation and future scenarios; * produce a comprehensive plan covering all aspects of sustainable development; * build on existing strategies and processes; * multiply links between national and local strategies; * include all these points in the financial and budget plan; * adopt fast controls to improve process piloting and identification of progress made; * implement effective participation mechanisms.Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future, et al (comp.); Options for Strengthening the Environment Pillar of Sustainable Development. Compilation of Civil Society Proposals on the Institutional Framework for the United Nations' Environmental Activities; 2007. Another group stated, “Consider the specific needs of developing countries and respect of the fundamental principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. Developed countries should promote technology transfer, new and additional financial resources, and capacity building for meaningful participation of developing countries in international environmental governance. Strengthening of international environmental governance should occur in the context of sustainable development and should involve civil society as an important stakeholder and agent of transformation.” \n",
      "=Global Environment Facility (GEF)\n",
      "= Created in 1991, the Global Environment Facility is an independent financial organization initiated by donor governments including Germany and France. It was the first financial organization dedicated to the environment at the global level. As of 2013 it had 179 members. Donations are used for projects covering biodiversity, climate change, international waters, destruction of the ozone layer, soil degradation and persistent organic pollutants. GEF's institutional structure includes UNEP, UNDP and the World Bank. It is the funding mechanism for the four environmental conventions: climate change, biodiversity, persistent organic pollutants and desertification. GEF transfers resources from developed countries to developing countries to fund UNDP, UNEP and World Bank projects. The World Bank manages the annual budget of US$561.10 million. The GEF has been criticized for its historic links with the World Bank, at least during its first phase during the 1990s,Andler, Lydia; The Secretariat of the Global Environment Facility: From Network to Bureaucracy; \"Global Governance Working Paper\", no. 24; Amsterdam et al.; The Global Governance Project; 2007. and for having favoured certain regions to the detriment of others.Werksman, Jake; Consolidating global environmental governance: New lessons from the GEF?; in Another view sees it as contributing to the emergence of a global \"green market\". It represents “an adaptation (of the World Bank) to this emerging world order, as a response to the emergence of environmental movements that are becoming a geopolitical force.” Developing countries demanded financial transfers to help them protect their environment. GEF is subject to economic profitability criteria, as is the case for all the conventions. It received more funds in its first three years than the UNEP has since its creation in 1972. GEF funding represents less than 1% of development aid between 1992 and 2002. \n",
      "=United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)\n",
      "= This intergovernmental institution meets twice a year to assess follow-up on Rio Summit goals. The CSD is made up of 53 member states, elected every three years and was reformed in 2004 to help improve implementation of Agenda 21. It meets twice a year, focusing on a specific theme during each two-year period: 2004-2005 was dedicated to water and 2006–2007 to climate change. The CSD has been criticized for its low impact, general lack of presence and the absence of Agenda 21 at the state level specifically, according to a report by the World Resources Institute. Its mission focuses on sequencing actions and establishing agreements puts it in conflict with institutions such as UNEP and OECD.Najam, A., Papa, M. and Taiyab, N. Global Environmental Governance. A Reform Agenda; IISD; 2006. \n",
      "=World Environment Organization (WEO)\n",
      "= A proposed World Environment Organization, analogous to the World Health Organization could be capable of adapting treaties and enforcing international standards.proposals The European Union, particularly France and Germany, and a number of NGOs favour creating a WEO. The United Kingdom, the US and most developing countries prefer to focus on voluntary initiatives.Tubiana, L.; Martimort-Asso, B.; Gouvernance internationale de l'environnement: les prochaines étapes (International Environmental Governance; the next stages); in \"Synthèse\", 2005, no. 01, Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales (IDDRI). WEO partisans maintain that it could offer better political leadership, improved legitimacy and more efficient coordination. Its detractors argue that existing institutions and missions already provide appropriate environmental governance; however the lack of coherence and coordination between them and the absence of clear division of responsibilities prevents them from greater effectiveness. \n",
      "=World Bank\n",
      "= The World Bank influences environmental governance through other actors, particularly the GEF. The World Bank's mandate is not sufficiently defined in terms of environmental governance despite the fact that it is included in its mission. However, it allocates 5 to 10% of its annual funds to environmental projects. The institution's capitalist vocation means that its investment is concentrated solely in areas which are profitable in terms of cost benefits, such as climate change action and ozone layer protection, whilst neglecting other such as adapting to climate change and desertification. Its financial autonomy means that it can make its influence felt indirectly on the creation of standards, and on international and regional negotiations.Marschinski, Robert; Behrle, Steffen; The World Bank: Making the Business Case for the Environment; \"Global Governance Working Paper No 21\"; Amsterdam et al; The Global Governance Project; 2006. Following intense criticism in the 1980s for its support for destructive projects which, amongst other consequences, caused deforestation of tropical forests, the World Bank drew up its own environment- related standards in the 1990s so it could correct its actions. These standards differ from UNEP's standards, meant to be the benchmark, thus discrediting the institution and sowing disorder and conflict in the world of environmental governance. Other financial institutions, regional development banks and the private sector also drew up their own standards. Criticism is not directed at the World Bank's standards in themselves, which Najam considered as “robust”, but at their legitimacy and efficacy. \n",

      " GEF \n",
      "\n",
      " The GEF's account of itself as of 2012 is as \"the largest public funder of projects to improve the global environment\", period, which \"provides grants for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic pollutants.\" It claims to have provided \"$10.5 billion in grants and leveraging $51 billion in co-financing for over 2,700 projects in over 165 countries [and] made more than 14,000 small grants directly to civil society and community-based organizations, totaling $634 million.\" It serves as mechanism for the: *Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) *United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) *Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) *Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) *implementation of Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer in some countries with \"economies in transition\" This mandate reflects the restructured GEF as of October 2011 . \n",
      "=World Trade Organization (WTO)\n",
      "= The WTO's mandate does not include a specific principle on the environment. All the problems linked to the environment are treated in such a way as to give priority to trade requirements and the principles of the WTO's own trade system. This produces conflictual situations. Even if the WTO recognizes the existence of MEAs, it denounces the fact that around 20 MEAs are in conflict with the WTO's trade regulations. Furthermore, certain MEAs can allow a country to ban or limit trade in certain products if they do not satisfy established environmental protection requirements. In these circumstances, if one country's ban relating to another country concerns two signatories of the same MEA, the principles of the treaty can be used to resolve the disagreement, whereas if the country affected by the trade ban with another country has not signed the agreement, the WTO demands that the dispute be resolved using the WTO's trade principles, in other words, without taking into account the environmental consequences. Some criticisms of the WTO mechanisms may be too broad. In a recently dispute over labelling of dolphin safe labels for tuna between the US and Mexico, the ruling was relatively narrow and did not, as some critics claimed, \n",
      "=International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n",
      "= The IMF's mission is \"to ensure the stability of the international monetary system\". The IMF Green Fund proposal of Dominique Strauss-Kahn specifically to address \"climate-related shocks in Africa\", despite receiving serious attention was rejected. Strauss-Kahn's proposal, backed by France and Britain, was that \"developed countries would make an initial capital injection into the fund using some of the $176 billion worth of SDR allocations from last year in exchange for a stake in the green fund.\" However, \"most of the 24 directors ... told Strauss-Kahn that climate was not part of the IMF's mandate and that SDR allocations are a reserve asset never intended for development issues.\" \n",
      "= UN ICLEI \n",
      "= The UN's main body for coordinating municipal and urban decision-makingICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability is named the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. Its slogan is \"Local Governments for Sustainability\". This body sponsored the concept of full cost accounting that makes environmental governance the foundation of other governance. ICLEIs projects and achievements include: *Convincing thousands of municipal leaders to sign the World Mayors and Municipal Leaders Declaration on Climate Change (2005) which notably requests of other levels of government that: :Global trade regimes, credits and banking reserve rules be reformed to advance debt relief and incentives to implement policies and practices that reduce and mitigate climate change. *Starting national councils to implement this and other key agreements, e.g., ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability USA *Spreading ecoBudget (2008) and Triple Bottom Line (2007) \"tools for embedding sustainability into council operations\", e.g. Guntur's Municipal Corporation, one of the first four to implement the entire framework. *Sustainability Planning Toolkit (launched 2009) integrating these and other tools *Cities Climate Registry (launched 2010) \\- part of UNEP Campaign on Cities and Climate Change ICLEI promotes best practice exchange among municipal governments globally, especially green infrastructure, sustainable procurement. \n",
      "=Other secretariats\n",
      "= Other international institutions incorporate environmental governance in their action plans, including: * United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), promoting development; * World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which works on the climate and atmosphere; * Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) working on the protection of agriculture, forests and fishing; * International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which focuses on nuclear security. Over 30 UN agencies and programmes support environmental management, according to Najam. This produces a lack of coordination, insufficient exchange of information and dispersion of responsibilities. It also results in proliferation of initiatives and rivalry between them. \n",
      "=Criticism\n",
      "= According to Bauer, Busch and Siebenhüner, the different conventions and multilateral agreements of global environmental regulation is increasing their secretariats' influence. Influence varies according to bureaucratic and leadership efficiency, choice of technical or client-centered. The United Nations is often the target of criticism, including from within over the multiplication of secretariats due to the chaos it produces. Using a separate secretariat for each MEA creates enormous overhead given the 45 international-scale and over 500 other agreements. \n",

      "=Environmental governance at the state level\n",
      "= Environmental protection has created opportunities for mutual and collective monitoring among neighbouring states. The European Union provides an example of the institutionalization of joint regional and state environmental governance. Key areas include information, led by the European Environment Agency (EEA), and the production and monitoring of norms by states or local institutions. See also the Environmental policy of the European Union. \n",
      "=State participation in global environmental governance\n",
      "= US refusal to ratify major environment agreements produced tensions with ratifiers in Europe and Japan. The World Bank, IMF and other institutions are dominated by the developed countries and do not always properly consider the requirements of developing countries. \n",
      "Business\n",
      " Environmental governance applies to business as well as government. Considerations are typical of those in other domains: * values (vision, mission, principles); * policy (strategy, objectives, targets); * oversight (responsibility, direction, training, communication); * process (management systems, initiatives, internal control, monitoring and review, stakeholder dialogue, transparency, environmental accounting, reporting and verification); * performance (performance indicators, benchmarking, eco-efficiency, reputation, compliance, liabilities, business development). White and Klernan among others discuss the correlation between environmental governance and financial performance. This correlation is higher in sectors where environmental impacts are greater. Business environmental issues include emissions, biodiversity, historical liabilities, product and material waste/recycling, energy use/supply and many others. Environmental governance has become linked to traditional corporate governance as an increasing number of shareholders are corporate environmental impacts. Corporate governance is the set of processes, customs, policies, laws, and institutions affecting the way a corporation (or company) is managed. Corporate governance is affected by the relationships among stakeholders. These stakeholders research and quantify performance to compare and contrast the environmental performance of thousands of companies. Large corporations with global supply chains evaluate the environmental performance of business partners and suppliers for marketing and ethical reasons. Some consumers seek environmentally friendly and sustainable products and companies. \n",
      "Non- governmental organizations\n",
      " According to Bäckstrand and Saward, “broader participation by non-state actors in multilateral environmental decisions (in varied roles such as agenda setting, campaigning, lobbying, consultation, monitoring, and implementation) enhances the democratic legitimacy of environmental governance.” Local activism is capable of gaining the support of the people and authorities to combat environmental degradatation. In Cotacachi, Ecuador, a social movement used a combination of education, direct action, the influence of local public authorities and denunciation of the mining company's plans in its own country, Canada, and the support of international environmental groups to influence mining activity.Bebbington, Anthony; et al.; Los movimientos sociales frente a la minería: disputando el desarrollo territorial andino (Social Movements and Mining: disputes over territorial development in the Andes); in J. Bengoa (ed.) \"Movimientos sociales y desarrollo territorial rural en América Latina\" (Social Movements and Territorial Rural Development in Latin America). Catalonia; 2007. Fisher cites cases in which multiple strategies were used to effect change.Fisher, Dana R.; Civil Society Protest and Participation: Civic Engagement Within the Multilateral Governance Regime pp. 176-201; in She describes civil society groups that pressure international institutions and also organize local events. Local groups can take responsibility for environmental governance in place of governments.Andrade Mendoza, Karen; La gobernanza ambiental en el Ecuador: El conflicto alrededor de la licencia Ambiental en el bloque 31, en el parque nacional Yasuní (Environmental Governance in Ecuador: the conflict concerning the environmental license for block 31 in the Yasuní National Park); FLACSO; Observatorio Socioambiental; Quito; 2008. According to Bengoa,Bengoa, José; et al. Movimientos sociales, gobernanza ambiental y desarrollo territorial (Social Movements, Environmental Governance and Territorial Development) ; Catalonia; 2007. “social movements have contributed decisively to the creation of an institutional platform wherein the fight against poverty and exclusion has become an inescapable benchmark.” But despite successes in this area, “these institutional changes have not produced the processes for transformation that could have made substantial changes to the opportunities available to rural inhabitants, particularly the poorest and those excluded from society.” He cites several reasons: * conflict between in- group cohesion and openness to outside influence; * limited trust between individuals; * contradiction between social participation and innovation; * criticisms without credible alternatives to environmentally damaging activities A successful initiative in Ecuador involved the establishment of stakeholder federations and management committees (NGOs, communities, municipalities and the ministry) for the management of a protected forest. \n",
      "Proposals\n",
      " The International Institute for Sustainable Development proposed an agenda for global governance. These objectives are: * expert leadership; * positioning science as the authoritative basis of sound environmental policy; * coherence and reasonable coordination; * well-managed institutions; * incorporate environmental concerns and actions within other areas of international policy and action \n",
      " Coherence and coordination \n",
      " Despite the increase in efforts, actors, agreements and treaties, the global environment continue to degrade at a rapid rate. From the big hole in Earth's ozone layer to over-fishing to the uncertainties of climate change, the world is confronted by several intrinsically global challenges. However, as the environmental agenda becomes more complicated and extensive, the current system has proven ineffective in addressing and tackling problems related to trans-boundary externalities and the environment is still experiencing degradation at unprecedented levels. InforesourcesGlobal Conventions and Environmental Governance identifies four major obstacles to global environmental governance, and describes measures in response. The four obstacles are: * parallel structures and competition, without a coherent strategy * contradictions and incompatibilities, without appropriate compromise * competition between multiple agreements with incompatible objectives, regulations and processes * integrating policy from macro- to micro- scales. Recommended measures: * MDGs (Millennium Development Goals)UN Millennium Goals and conventions, combining sustainability and reduction of poverty and equity; * country-level approach linking global and local scales * coordination and division of tasks in a multilateral approach that supports developing countries and improves coordination between donor countries and institutions * use of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs)Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers in development planning * transform conflicts into tradeoffs, synergies and win-win options Contemporary debates surrounding global environmental governance have converged on the idea of developing a stronger and more effective institutional framework. The views on how to achieve this, however, still hotly debated. Currently, rather than teaming up with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), international environmental responsibilities have been spread across many different agencies including: a) specialised agencies within the UN system such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation and others; b) the programs in the UN system such as the UN Development Program; c) the UN regional economic and social commission; d) the Bretton Woods institutions; e) the World Trade Organisation and; f) the environmentally focused mechanisms such as the Global Environment Facility and close to 500 international environmental agreements. Some analysts also argue that multiple institutions and some degree of overlap and duplication in policies is necessary to ensure maximum output from the system. Others, however, claim that institutions have become too dispersed and lacking in coordination which can be damaging to their effectiveness in global environmental governance. Whilst there are various arguments for and against a WEO, the key challenge, however, remains the same: how to develop a rational and effective framework that will protect the global environment efficiently. \n",
      " Democratization \n",
      " Starting in 2002, Saward and others began to view the Earth Summit process as capable opening up the possibility of stakeholder democracy. The summits were deliberative rather than simply participative, with NGOs, women, men, indigenous peoples and businesses joining the decision-making process alongside states and international organizations, characterized by: * the importance given to scientific and technical considerations * the official and unofficial participation of many actors with heterogeneous activity scopes * growing uncertainty * a new interpretation of international law and social organization models As of 2013, the absence of joint rules for composing such fora leads to the development of non-transparent relations that favour the more powerful stakeholders. Criticisms assert that they act more as a lobbying platform, wherein specific interest groups attempt to influence governments. \n",
      "Institutional reform\n",
      " Actors inside and outside the United Nations are discussing possibilities for global environmental governance that provides a solution to current problems of fragility, coordination and coherence.Resolution 60/1 of the United Nations General Assembly. Deliberation is focusing on the goal of making UNEP more efficient. A 2005 resolution recognizes “the need for more efficient environmental activities in the United Nations system, with enhanced coordination, improved policy advice and guidance, strengthened scientific knowledge, assessment and cooperation, better treaty compliance, while respecting the legal autonomy of the treaties, and better integration of environmental activities in the broader sustainable development framework.” Proposals include:UN environmental governance report * greater and better coordination between agencies; * strengthen and acknowledge UNEP's scientific role; * identify MEA areas to strengthen coordination, cooperation and teamwork between different agreements; * increase regional presence; * implement the Bali Strategic Plan on improving technology training and support for the application of environmental measures in poor countries; * demand that UNEP and MEAs participate formally in all relevant WTO committees as observers. * strengthen its financial situation; * improve secretariats’ efficiency and effectiveness. One of the main studies addressing this issue proposes: * clearly divide tasks between development organizations, UNEP and the MEAs * adopt a political direction for environmental protection and sustainable development * authorize the UNEP Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum to adopt the UNEP medium-term strategy * allow Member States to formulate and administer MEAs an independent secretariat for each convention * support UNEP in periodically assessing MEAs and ensure coordination and coherence * establish directives for setting up national/regional platforms capable of incorporating MEAs in the Common Country Assessment (CCA) process and United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF)The CCA is the main diagnostic tool available for teams working in UN countries and their partners. It is used to assess and create a shared understanding of the underlying challenges facing a country during its development. The UNDAF is a product of the CCA analysis and collaboration process and provides the basis for UN cooperation programmes. (Source: ISDR; Words into Action: A Guide for Implementing the Hyogo Framework; United Nations; 2007; chapter 4; p. 81-120). * establish a global joint planning framework * study the aptitude and efficiency of environmental activities’ funding, focusing on differential costs * examine and redefine the concept of funding differential costs as applicable to existing financial mechanisms * reconsider remits, division of tasks and responsibilities between entities that provide services to the multipartite conferences.

      " Individuals can modify consumption, based on voluntary simplicity: changes in purchasing habits, simplified lifestyles (less work, less consumption, more socialization and constructive leisure time). But individual actions must not replace vigilance and pressure on policies. Notions of responsible consumption developed over decades, revealing the political nature of individual purchases, according to the principle that consumption should satisfy the population's basic needs. These needs comprise the physical wellbeing of individuals and society, a healthy diet, access to drinking water and plumbing, education, healthcare and physical safety. The general attitude centres on the need to reduce consumption and reuse and recycle materials. In the case of food consumption, local, organic and fair trade products which avoid ill treatment of animals has become a major trend. Alternatives to the personal automobile are increasing, including public transport, car sharing and bicycles and alternative propulsion systems. Alternative energy sources are becoming less costly. Ecological industrial processes turn the waste from one industry into raw materials for another. Governments can reduce subsidies/increase taxes/tighten regulation on unsustainable activities. The Community Environmental governance Global Alliance encourages holistic approaches to environmental and economic challenges, incorporating indigenous knowledge.

      " A programme of national workshops on synergies between the three Rio Conventions launched in late 2000, in collaboration with the relevant secretariats. The goal was to strengthen coordination at the local level by: * sharing information * promoting political dialogue to obtain financial support and implement programmes * enabling the secretariats to update their joint work programmes. According to Campbell,Campbell, Laura B.; The Effectiveness of WTO and WIPO: Lessons for Environmental Governance? in “In the context of globalization, the question of linking up environmental themes with other subjects, such as trade, investment and conflict resolution mechanisms, as well as the economic incentives to participate in and apply agreements would seem to provide an important lesson for the effective development of environmental governance structures.” Environmental concerns would become part of the global economic system. “These problems also contain the seeds of a new generation of international conflicts that could affect both the stability of international relations and collective security. Which is why the concept of ‘collective security’ has arisen.” Moving local decisions to the global level is as important as the way in which local initiatives and best practices are part of a global system. KanieKanie, Norichika; Global Environmental Governance in Terms of Vertical Linkages; pp. 86-113 points out that NGOs, scientists, international institutions and stakeholder partnerships can reduce the distance that separates the local and international levels. \n",

The reference point (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate, radial distance or simply radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or azimuth. Angles in polar notation are generally expressed in either degrees or radians (2 rad being equal to 360°).

      "E () is a 2006 Indian Tamil-language medical thriller film directed by S. P. Jananathan. The film stars Jiiva and Nayanthara, while Ashish Vidyarthi, Pasupathy and Karunas played supporting roles. The film's music is composed by director Srikanth Deva. The film was appreciated for its fresh storyline connecting to real-life medical crimes. The movie was a commercial failure, garnering mixed critical response. \n",
      " Plot \n",
      " The movie revolves around Easwaran alias E, an orphan brought up in the musty, teeming slums of Chennai by an old woman. For him, money is God. He comes across Jothy, a bar dancer who settles down in the same locality. After a few encounters, they get acquainted with each other. E's simple ways attract Jothy. Coming to know of E's past, Jothy tries desperately to correct his ways and set him on the right path. Meanwhile, Dr. Ramakrishnan takes up the task of testing a medicine devised by a foreign company, which may come handy in killing people in thousands, especially during times of war. Ramakrishnan chooses Jothy's sister and E's grandmother as specimens for the test. He cashes in on the ignorance to slum dwellers. Things take a turn when E rescues Ramakrishnan from a murder bid by Nellai Mani. A sequence of events brings Nellai Mani and E together. Without knowing Nellai Mani's motive, E hides him in a secret place and decides to hand him over to Ramakrishnan for a huge sum. Slowly, E gets attracted by Nellai Mani's good ways. Through him, E discovers Ramakrishnan's ulterior motives. Nellai Mani, a revolutionary fighting for a cause, tries to bring about a change in E's heart. Succeeding in his attempt, Nellai Mani lays down his life, leaving E to complete his task. The rest is all about how E puts an end to Ramakrishnan and his evil ways. \n",

      "answer: title: Eternalism (philosophy of time)\n",
      "thumb|Illustration of the concept of eternalism, showing a man walking his dog. Time progresses through the series of snapshots from the bottom of the page to the top. In a common sense view of time, each of those four instants would exist one after another. According to eternalism, those four instants all equally exist. In the philosophy of space and time, eternalism is an approach to the ontological nature of time, which takes the view that all existence in time is equally real, as opposed to presentism or the growing block universe theory of time, in which at least the future is not the same as any other time. Some forms of eternalism give time a similar ontology to that of space, as a dimension, with different times being as real as different places, and future events are \"already there\" in the same sense other places are already there, and that there is no objective flow of time. It is sometimes referred to as the \"block time\" or \"block universe\" theory due to its description of space-time as an unchanging four-dimensional \"block\", as opposed to the view of the world as a three-dimensional space modulated by the passage of time. \n",
      "The present\n",
      " In classical philosophy, time is divided into three distinct regions: the \"past\", the \"present\", and the \"future\". Using that representational model, the past is generally seen as being immutably fixed, and the future as at least partly undefined. As time passes, the moment that was once the present becomes part of the past, and part of the future, in turn, becomes the new present. In this way time is said to pass, with a distinct present moment moving forward into the future and leaving the past behind. One view of this type, presentism, argues that only the present exists. The present does not travel forward through an environment of time, moving from a real point in the past and toward a real point in the future. Instead, is merely changes. The past and future do not exist and are only concepts used to describe the real, isolated, and changing present. This conventional model presents a number of difficult philosophical problems and may be difficult to reconcile with currently accepted scientific theories such as the theory of relativity. It can be argued that special relativity eliminates the concept of absolute simultaneity and a universal present: according to the relativity of simultaneity, observers in different frames of reference can have different measurements of whether a given pair of events happened at the same time or at different times, with there being no physical basis for preferring one frame's judgments over another's. However, there are events that may be non-simultaneous in all frames of reference: when one event is within the light cone of another—its causal past or causal future—then observers in all frames of reference show that one event preceded the other. The causal past and causal future are consistent within all frames of reference, but any other time is \"elsewhere\", and within it there is no present, past, or future. There is no physical basis for a set of events that represents the present. Many philosophers have argued that relativity implies eternalism. Philosopher of science Dean Rickles says that, \"the consensus among philosophers seems to be that special and general relativity are incompatible with presentism.\" Christian Wüthrich argues that supporters of presentism can only salvage absolute simultaneity if they reject either empiricism or relativity. Dean Zimmerman and others argue for a single privileged frame whose judgments about length, time and simultaneity are the true ones, even if there is no empirical way to distinguish this frame. \n",

      " Antiquity \n",
      " Arguments for and against an independent flow of time have been raised since antiquity, represented by fatalism, reductionism, and Platonism: Classical fatalism argues that every proposition about the future exists, and it is either true or false, hence there is a set of every true proposition about the future, which means these propositions describe the future exactly as it is, and this future is true and unavoidable. Fatalism is challenged by positing that there are propositions that are neither true nor false, for example they may be indeterminate. Reductionism questions whether time can exist independently of the relation between events, and Platonism argues that time is absolute, and it exists independently of the events that occupy it. Earlier, pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Parmenides of Elea had posited that existence is timeless and change is impossible (an idea popularized by his disciple Zeno of Elea and his paradoxes about motion). \n",

      " The philosopher Katherin A. Rogers argued that Anselm of Canterbury took an eternalist view of time,Katherin A. Rogers (2007). \"Anselmian Eternalism\". Faith and Philosophy 24 (1):3-27. although the philosopher Brian Leftow argued against this interpretation,Brian Leftow (2009). \"Anselmian Presentism. Faith and Philosophy\" 26 (3):297-319. suggesting that Anselm instead advocated a type of presentism. Rogers responded to this paper, defending her original interpretation.Katherin Rogers (2009). \"Back to Eternalism\". Faith and Philosophy 26 (3):320-338. Rogers also discusses this issue in her book Anselm on Freedom, using the term \"four- dimensionalism\" rather than \"eternalism\" for the view that \"the present moment is not ontologically privileged\", and commenting that \"Boethius and Augustine do sometimes sound rather four-dimensionalist, but Anselm is apparently the first consistently and explicitly to embrace the position.\" Taneli Kukkonen argues in the Oxford Handbook of Medieval Philosophy that \"what Augustine's and Anselm's mix of eternalist and presentist, tenseless and tensed language tells is that medieval philosophers saw no need to choose sides\" the way modern philosophers do.From Kukkonen's chapter on \"Eternity\" in The Oxford Handbook of Medieval Philosophy edited by John Marenbon (2012), p. 529. Augustine of Hippo wrote that God is outside of time—that time exists only within the created universe. Thomas Aquinas took the same view, and many theologians agree. On this view, God would perceive something like a block universe, while time might appear differently to the finite beings contained within it.John Polkinghorne (2011). Science and Religion in Quest of Truth, p. 64. \n",
      " Modern period \n",
      " One of the most famous arguments about the nature of time in modern philosophy is presented in The Unreality of Time by J. M. E. McTaggart.J. M. E. McTaggart, \"The Unreality of Time\", Mind 17: 457–73; reprinted in J. M. E. McTaggart, The Nature of Existence, Vol. 2, 1927, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: Book 5, Chapter 33. It argues that time is an illusion. McTaggart argued that the description of events as existing in absolute time is self-contradictory, because the events have to have properties about being in the past and in the future, which are incompatible with each other. McTaggart viewed this as a contradiction in the concept of time itself, and concluded that reality is non-temporal. He called this concept the B-theory of time. Dirck Vorenkamp, a professor of religious studies, argued in his paper \"B-Series Temporal Order in Dogen's Theory of Time\"Vorenkamp, Dirck (1995). \"B-Series Temporal Order in Dogen's Theory of Time\". Philosophy East and West, Volume 45, Number 3, 1995 July, P.387-408. that the Zen Buddhist teacher Dōgen presented views on time that contained all the main elements of McTaggart's B-series view of time (which denies any objective present), although he noted that some of Dōgen's reasoning also contained A-Series notions, which Vorenkamp argued may indicate some inconsistency in Dōgen's thinking. A. Halliday has attempted to rationalise time by arguing that it is finite. This was founded on the thought that, if an entity has, or is assigned, parts then those parts must be finite. Assembling finite parts must result in a finite whole. Therefore, it follows that past, present and future are finite. It then follows that, as they also form a whole, then the whole of time is finite. In the simplest case, if time is finite then it is limited. Time is thought of as existing inside of space. If there cannot be a gap between the edge of time and the limits of space, then time fills all of space, ensuring change everywhere. Therefore, time cannot flow if flow demands movement from one point to another? \n",
      " Quantum physics \n",
      " Some philosophers appeal to a specific theory that is \"timeless\" in a more radical sense than the rest of physics, the theory of quantum gravity. This theory is used, for instance, in Julian Barbour's theory of timelessness.[Barbour, Julian, The End of Time, 1999 Oxford University Press ] On the other hand, George Ellis argues that time is absent in cosmological theories because of the details they leave out. Recently, Hrvoje Nikolić has argued that a block time model solves the black hole information paradox. \n",
      " Objections \n",
      " Philosophers such as John Lucas argue that \"The Block universe gives a deeply inadequate view of time. It fails to account for the passage of time, the pre-eminence of the present, the directedness of time and the difference between the future and the past.\"John LucasThe Future p8 Similarly, Karl Popper argued in his discussion with Albert Einstein against determinism and eternalism from a common-sense standpoint. A flow-of-time theory with a strictly deterministic future, which nonetheless does not exist in the same sense as the present, would not satisfy common-sense intuitions about time. Some have argued that common-sense flow-of-time theories can be compatible with eternalism, for example John G. Cramer’s transactional interpretation. Kastner (2010) \"proposed that in order to preserve the elegance and economy of the interpretation, it may be necessary to consider offer and confirmation waves as propagating in a “higher space” of possibilities. In Time Reborn, Lee Smolin argues that time is physically fundamental, in contrast to Einstein's view that time is an illusion. Smolin hypothesizes that the laws of physics are not fixed, but rather evolve over time via a form of cosmological natural selection.\"Time Reborn: a new theory of time - a new view of the world\". Royal Society of Arts. May 21, 2013. Archived from the original on July 28, 2013. In The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time, co-authored with philosopher Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Smolin goes into more detail on his views on the physical passage of time. In contrast to the orthodox block universe view, Smolin argues that what instead exists is a \"thick present\" in which two events in the present can be causally related to each other. Marina Cortês and Lee Smolin also argue that certain classes of discrete dynamical systems demonstrate time asymmetry and irreversibility, which is inconsistent with the block universe interpretation of time. Avshalom Elitzur vehemently rejects the block universe interpretation of time. At the Time in Cosmology conference, held at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in 2016, Elitzur said: \"I’m sick and tired of this block universe, ... I don’t think that next Thursday has the same footing as this Thursday. The future does not exist. It does not! Ontologically, it’s not there.\"Falk, D. (2016, July 19). A Debate Over the Physics of Time. Retrieved February 14, 2019, from https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-debate-over-the-physics-of-time-20160719/ Elitzur and Shahar Dolev argue that quantum mechanical experiments such as the Quantum Liar and the evaporation of black holes challenge the mainstream block universe model, and support the existence of an objective passage of time. Elitzur and Dolev believe that an objective passage of time and relativity can be reconciled, and that it would resolve many of the issues with the block universe and the conflict between relativity and quantum mechanics. Additionally, Elitzur and Dolev believe that certain quantum mechanical experiments provide evidence of apparently inconsistent histories, and that spacetime itself may therefore be subject to change affecting entire histories. \n",

      "In fiction\n",
      " Ideas related to Eternalism are described in Kurt Vonnegut’s novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. In the context of the novel, the Tralfamadorians are an alien species, members of which experience every point in time simultaneously. A character at one point argues that since all moments exist simultaneously, everyone is always alive-- a claim which implies Eternalism. The protagonist of the story, Billy Pilgrim, additionally lives his life out of sequence. It is stated that each moment of his life exists independent of the others, which is a clause of Eternalism. Eternalism is also indirectly referenced in the comic book series Watchmen by Alan Moore. At one point, the character Dr. Manhattan describes how he perceives time in a manner which is consistent with Eternalism. He states that, from his perspective, the past, present, and future occur simultaneously. This is evidenced when he speaks about past or future events in the present tense, which is a frequent occurrence. His last line in the series is, \"Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends.\" The science fiction novel The Number of the Beast , by Robert A. Heinlein, explores concepts related to Block Time. One protagonist, the mathematician Dr. Jacob Burroughs, invents a device which navigates through time as one scalar dimension in a six-dimensional universe. The novel unfolds across a variety of parallel worlds. Along with block time, it is implied that there exists a block plenum of innumerable alternate universes, with each being separated by one quantum step along an axis of space-time. The game Warframe introduces eternalism in the story quest \"The New War.\" The example provided in the game describes a situation in which a girl's parents are trapped in separate cells, but the girl can only save one of them, as the other parent will be killed in response. According to the rules of eternalism, as explained by one of the characters, there will be different versions of reality regarding which parent is saved. The reason provided is that though the girl is assigned to one future, the other is no less real. \n",

      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Enzyme replacement therapy\n",
      "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a medical treatment which replaces an enzyme that is deficient or absent in the body. Usually, this is done by giving the patient an intravenous (IV) infusion of a solution containing the enzyme. ERT is available for some lysosomal storage diseases: Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, MPS I, MPS II (Hunter syndrome), MPS VI and Pompe disease. ERT does not correct the underlying genetic defect, but it increases the concentration of the enzyme that the patient is lacking. ERT has also been used to treat patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) resulting from an adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID). Other treatment options for patients with enzyme or protein deficiencies include substrate reduction therapy, gene therapy, and bone-marrow derived stem cell transplantation. \n",
      " History \n",
      " ERT was developed in 1964 by Christian de Duve and Roscoe Brady. Leading work was done on this subject at the Department of Physiology at the University of Alberta by Mark J. Poznansky and Damyanti Bhardwaj, where a model for enzyme therapy was developed using rats. ERT was not used in clinical practice until 1991, after the FDA gave orphan drug approval for the treatment of Gaucher disease with Alglucerase. ERTs were initially manufactured by isolating the therapeutic enzyme from human placenta. The FDA has approved ERTs that are derived from other human cells, animal cells (i.e. Chinese hamster ovary cells, or CHO cells), and plant cells. \n",
      " Medical uses \n",
      " Lysosomal storage diseases are fatal group of diseases and a main application of ERT. Lysosomes are cellular organelles that are responsible for the metabolism of many different macromolecules and proteins. They use enzymes to break down macromolecules, which are recycled or disposed. As of 2012, there are 50 lysosomal storage diseases, and more are still being discovered.\"Lysosomal Storage Disorders – NORD (National Organization For Rare Disorders)\". NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders). Apr. 2017, from https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/lysosomal-storage-disorders/. These disorders arise because of genetic mutations that prevent the production of certain enzymes used in the lysosomes. The missing enzyme often leads to a build-up of the substrate within the body. This can result in a variety of symptoms, many of which are severe and can affect the skeleton, brain, skin, heart, and the central nervous system. Increasing the concentration of the missing enzyme within the body has been shown to improve the body's normal cellular metabolic processes and reduce substrate concentration in the body. ERT has also been successful in treating severe combined immunodeficiency caused by an adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID). This is a fatal childhood disease that requires early medical intervention. When the enzyme adenosine deaminase is deficient in the body, the result is a toxic build-up of metabolites that impair lymphocyte development and function. Many ADA deficient children with SCID have been treated with the polyethylene glycol- conjugated adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA) enzyme.

      " Administration \n",
      " ERT is administered by IV infusion. Typically, infusions occur every week or every two weeks. For some types of ERT, these infusions can occur as infrequently as every four weeks. \n",
      " Complications \n",
      " ERT is not a cure for lysosomal storage diseases, and it requires lifelong IV infusions of the therapeutic enzyme. This procedure is expensive; in the United States, it may cost over $200,000 annually. The distribution of the therapeutic enzyme in the body (biodistribution) after these IV infusions is not uniform. The enzyme in less available to certain areas in the body, like the bones, lungs, brain. For this reason, many symptoms of lysosomal storage diseases remain untreated by ERT, especially neurological symptoms. Additionally, the efficacy of ERT is often reduced due to an unwanted immune response against the enzyme, which prevents metabolic function. \n",
      " Other treatments for enzyme deficiencies \n",
      " Substrate reduction therapy is another method for treating lysosomal storage diseases. In this treatment, the accumulated compounds are inhibited from forming in the body of a patient with a lysosomal storage disease. The accumulated compounds are responsible for the symptoms of these disorders, and they form via a multi-step biological pathway. Substrate reduction therapy uses a small molecule to interrupt this multi-step pathway and inhibit the biosynthesis of these compounds. This type of treatment is taken orally. It does not induce an unwanted immune response, and a single type of small molecule could be used to treat many lysosomal storage diseases. Substrate reduction therapy is FDA approved and there is at least one treatment available on the market. Gene therapy aims to replace a missing protein in the body through the use of vectors, usually viral vectors.\"How does gene therapy work? - Genetics Home Reference.\" U.S. National Library of Medicine. April 18, 2017, from https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/therapy/procedures. In gene therapy, a gene encoding for a certain protein is inserted into a vector. The vector containing the therapeutic gene is then injected into the patient. Once inside the body the vector introduces the therapeutic gene into host cells, and the protein encoded by the newly inserted gene is then produced by the body's own cells. This type of therapy can correct for the missing protein/enzyme in patients with lysosomal storage diseases. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is another treatment for lysosomal storage diseases. HSCs are derived from bone-marrow.Domen, J., Wagers, A., & Weissman, I. \"Bone Marrow (Hematopoietic) Stem Cells.\" April 19, 2017, from https://stemcells.nih.gov/info/Regenerative_Medicine/2006chapter2.htm. These cells have the ability to mature into the many cell types that comprise blood, including red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. Patients with enzyme deficiencies often undergo HSC transplantations in which HSCs from a healthy donor are injected. This treatment introduces HSCs that regularly produce the deficient enzyme since they have normal metabolic function. This treatment is often used to treat the central nervous system of patients with some lysosomal storage diseases. \n",

      "answer: title: Fixed-target experiment\n",
      "A fixed-target experiment in particle physics is an experiment in which a beam of accelerated particles is collided with a stationary target. The moving beam (also known as a projectile) consists of charged particles such as electrons or protons and is accelerated to relativistic speed. The fixed target can be a solid block or a liquid or a gaseous medium. These experiments are distinct from the collider-type experiments in which two moving particle beams are accelerated and collided. The famous Rutherford gold foil experiment, performed between 1908 and 1913, was one of the first fixed-target experiments, in which the alpha particles were targeted at a thin gold foil. \n",
      " Explanation \n",
      " The energy involved in a fixed target experiment is 4 times smaller compared to that in collider with the dual beams of same energy. More over in collider experiments energy of two beams is available to produce new particles, while in fixed target case a lot of energy is just expended in giving velocities to the newly created particles. This clearly implies that fixed target experiments are not helpful when it comes to increasing the energy scales of experiments. The targeted source also wears down with number of strikes and usually require a regular replacement. Current day fixed-target experiments try to use highly resistant materials but the damage cannot be avoided entirely. The fixed target experiments have a significant advantage for experiments that require higher luminosity (rate of interaction).https://edu.itp.phys.ethz.ch/hs10/ppp1/PPP1_4.pdf The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, which is an upcoming upgraded version of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, will attain total integrated luminosity of around \\mathrm{5 \\times 10^{35} cm^{-2} s^{-1}} in its run. While luminosity scale of about \\mathrm{5 \\times 10^{34} cm^{-2} s^{-1}} have already been approached by older fixed target experiments such at the E288 lead by Leon Lederman at Fermilab. Another advantage for fixed-target experiments is that they are easier and cheaper to build compared to the collider accelerators. \n",
      " Experimental facilities \n",
      " Rutherford's gold foil experiment that led to the discovery that mass and positive charge of an atom was concentrated in a small nucleus was probably the first fixed-target experiment. Later half of the 20th century saw the rise of particle and nuclear physics facilities such as CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and Fermilab's Tevatron where number of fixed-target experiments led to new discoveries. 43 fixed-target experiments were conducted at the Tevatron during its run period from 1983 to 2000. While proton and other beams from SPS are still used by fixed target experiments such as NA61/SHINE and COMPASS collaboration. A fixed-target facility at the LHC, called AFTER@LHC, is also being planned. \n",
      " Physics at fixed-target experiments \n",
      " The fixed-target experiments are mainly implemented for the intensive studies of the rare processes, dynamics at high Bjorken x, diffractive physics, spin-correlations, and numerous nuclear phenomena. The experiments at Fermilab's Tevatron facility covered wide range of physics domains such as testing the theoretical predictions of quantum chromodynamics theory, studies of structure of proton, neutron and mesons, and studies of heavy quarks such as charm and bottom. Several experiments looked into CP symmetry tests. Few collaborations also studied the hyperons and the neutrinos created at fixed-target setups. NA61/SHINE at the SPS is studying the phase transitions in strongly interacting matter and physics related to onset of confinement. While the COMPASS experiment investigates the structure of the hadrons. AFTER@LHC aims at the studies of gluon and quark distribution inside protons and neutrons using fixed-target facilities. There are possibilities to observe the W and Z bosons as well. Observation and studies of the Drell-Yan pair production and quarkonium are also being looked into. Thus the number of options available to explore extreme and rare physics at the fixed-target experiments are numerous. \n",

      "answer: title: Functional contextualism\n",
      "Functional contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general and the field of behavior analysis and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as relational frame theoryHayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. & Roche, B. (Eds.). (2001).

Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context. \n",
      "Contextualism\n",
      " The form of contextualism from which functional contextualism emerged is the one described by the philosopher Stephen C. Pepper in his book World Hypotheses: A Study in Evidence.Pepper, S.C. (1942). World hypotheses: A study in evidence. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. In this work, Pepper noted that philosophical systems tend to cluster around a few distinct \"world hypotheses\" or \"world views\". Each world view is characterized by a distinctive underlying root metaphor and truth criterion. Root metaphors are based on seemingly well- understood, common-sense, everyday objects or ideas, and serve as the basic analogy by which an analyst attempts to understand the world. A world view's root metaphor roughly corresponds to its ontological assumptions, or views about the nature of being or existence (e.g., whether the universe is deterministic or not). Truth criteria are inextricably linked to their root metaphors, and provide the basis for evaluating the validity of analyses. A world view's truth criterion roughly corresponds to its epistemological assumptions, or views about the nature of knowledge and truth (e.g., whether it is discovered or constructed). The root metaphor of contextualism is the \"act in context\", whereby any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed \"successful working\", whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well it is said to mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid insofar it as it leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical pragmatism developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and others. \n",
      "Varieties of contextualism\n",
      " Analytic goals are vitally important to the contextualistic world view. This is because the analytic tools of contextualism—its root metaphor and truth criterion—both hinge on the purpose of the analysis, and neither can be mounted effectively without a clearly specified analytic goal. The pragmatic truth criterion of \"successful working\" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because \"success\" can only be measured in relation to the achievement of some objective.Dewey, J. (1953). Essays in experimental logic. New York: Dover (Original work published 1916) Likewise, the root metaphor of the \"act-in-context\" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because there would be no basis on which to restrict the analysis to a subset of the infinite expanse of the act's historical and environmental context.Gifford, E.V. & Hayes, S.C. (1999). Functional contextualism: A pragmatic philosophy for behavioral science. In W. O'Donohue & R. Kitchener (Eds.), Handbook of behaviorism (pp. 285–327). San Diego: Academic Press. Without a clear analytic goal, the contextualist could analyze the endless context of an act in perpetuity, without ever knowing when the analysis was complete or good enough to be deemed \"true\" or \"useful\". It is very difficult for a contextualist without an explicit goal to construct or share knowledge. Contextualists can, and do, adopt different analytic goals, and the many different varieties of contextualism can be distinguished by their goals.Hayes, S.C. (1993). Analytic goals and the varieties of scientific contextualism. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese & T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), Varieties of scientific contextualism (pp. 11–27). Reno, NV: Context Press. Based on their overarching analytic goals, contextualistic theories can be divided into two general categories: \"descriptive contextualism\" and \"functional contextualism\". \n",
      "Descriptive contextualism\n",
      " Descriptive contextualists seek to understand the complexity and richness of a whole event through a personal and aesthetic appreciation of its participants and features. This approach reveals a strong adherence to the root metaphor of contextualism and can be likened to the enterprise of history, in which stories of the past are constructed in an attempt to understand whole events. The knowledge constructed by the descriptive contextualist is personal, ephemeral, specific, and spatiotemporally restricted.Morris, E.K. (1993). Contextualism, historiography, and the history of behavior analysis. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese & T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), Varieties of scientific contextualism (pp. 137-165). Reno, NV: Context Press. Like a historical narrative, it is knowledge that reflects an in-depth personal understanding of a particular event that occurred (or is occurring) at a particular time and place. Most forms of contextualism, including social constructionism, dramaturgy, hermeneutics, and narrative approaches, are instances of descriptive contextualism. \n",
      "Functional contextualism\n",
      " Functional contextualists, on the other hand, seek to predict and influence events using empirically based concepts and rules. This approach reveals a strong adherence to contextualism's extremely practical truth criterion and can be likened to the enterprise of science or engineering, in which general rules and principles are used to predict and control events.Hayes, S. C., & Brownstein, A. J. (2016). Mentalism, behavior-behavior relations, and a behavior-analytic view of the purposes of science. Rules or theories that do not contribute to the achievement of one's practical goals are ignored or rejected. Knowledge constructed by the functional contextualist is general, abstract, and spatiotemporally unrestricted.Fox, E. J. (2006). Constructing a pragmatic science of learning and instruction with functional contextualism. Educational Technology Research & Development, 54 (1), 5-36. Like a scientific principle, it is knowledge that is likely to be applicable to all (or many) similar such events, regardless of time or place. \n",

      "----------------------\n",
      "answer: title: Fellgett's advantage\n",
      "Fellgett's advantage or the multiplex advantage is an improvement in signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) that is gained when taking multiplexed measurements rather than direct measurements. The name is derived from P. B. Fellgett, who first made the observation as part of his PhD. When measuring a signal whose noise is dominated by detector noise, a multiplexed measurement such as the signal generated by a Fourier transform spectrometer can produce a relative improvement in SNR, compared to an equivalent scanning monochromator, of the order of the square root of m, where m is the number of sample points comprising the spectrum. \n",
      "Exit slit\n",
      " Sellar and Boreman have argued that this SNR improvement can be considered as a result of freedom from needing an exit slit inside the spectrometer, since an exit slit reduces the light collected by the detector by the same factor. \n",
      "Emission\n",
      " There is an additional multiplex advantage for emission lines of atomic and molecular spectra. At the peak of the emission line, a monochromator measurement will be noisy, since the noise is proportional to the square root of the signal. For the same reason, the measurement will be less noisy at the baseline of the spectrum. In a multiplexed measurement, however, the noise in a given measurement is spread more or less evenly across the spectrum, regardless of the local signal intensity. Thus, multiplexed measurements can achieve higher SNR at the emission line peaks. There is a corresponding multiplex disadvantage, however. When the signals of interest are absorption lines in the spectrum, then the same principle will produce increased noise at the valleys of the absorption lines relative to the noise of a scanning monochromator. \n",
      "Shot noise\n",
      " However, if the detector is shot noise dominated (which is typically the case for a photomultiplier tube), noise will be proportional to the square root of the power, so that for a broad flat spectrum the noise will be proportional to the square root of m, where m is the number of sample points comprising the spectrum, thus this disadvantage precisely offsets the Fellgett advantage. Shot noise is the main reason Fourier transform spectroscopy has never been popular for UV and visible light spectrometry. \n",

A multiplexed display has several advantages compared to a non-multiplexed display: * fewer wires (often, far fewer wires) are needed * simpler driving electronics can be used * both lead to reduced cost * reduced power consumption Multiplexed displays can be divided into two broad categories: # character-oriented displays # pixel-oriented displays ==Character-oriented displays== Most character-oriented displays (such as seven-segment displays, fourteen-segment displays, and sixteen-segment dis\n",

Mass spectrometry generally gives significantly better analytical performance, but is also significantly more complex. This complexity translates into higher purchase costs, higher operational costs, more operator training, and a greater number of components that can potentially fail.

      " The Confederation of Human Worlds comprises about two hundred semi-autonomous settled worlds. Some of those worlds are rich and powerful, others are not. A coalition of a dozen lesser worlds, tired of being second class citizens, decides to secede from the Confederation. What they do not know is the threat of an alien species known as the Skinks hangs over the entire confederation. The Skink Threat is top secret, no citizens know of them. Ever since the discovery of these aliens, the Confederation has beefed up its defences on the out lying colonies. On Ravenette, one of the Coalition worlds, protesters gather at the main gate of the Confederation army base. Someone unknown shoots into the crowd, killing a protester and setting off a bloody riot that kills many civilians and soldiers. The Coalition started the riot and provoked the soldiers even though the soldiers did not shoot into the crowd, news networks say otherwise. The Coalition declares war, and brings all its military might against the Confederation forces on Ravenette—banking on the likelihood that they will achieve victory before reinforcements arrive, and that the Confederation will agree to negotiate a peaceable parting. They guessed wrong. An army division and 34th FIST are soon on the scene, holding the line until more reinforcements arrive. But matters get worse when General Jason Billie is given command of the Confederation forces. General Billie not only has no combat command experience, he hates Marines. \n",

      "The General\n",
      " The first half of the book, titled \"The General,\" focuses on General Bel Riose of the Galactic Empire, who governs the planet Siwenna. He comes across myths regarding the Foundation and attempts to confirm them by coercing the aid of a Siwennian named Ducem Barr, whose father Onum met the Foundation trader Hober Mallow decades ago. After further research through visiting Foundation territory Riose determines that they're a threat to the Empire and declares war upon them, both to fulfill his duty to the Empire and satisfy his personal pursuit of glory. Barr is familiar of Hari Seldon's psychohistory and through it is confident of the Foundation's inevitable victory, an assertion Riose repeatedly disputes. Riose captures and interrogates a Foundation trader named Lathan Devers, who reveals in private to Barr that he allowed himself to be taken in order to disrupt Riose's operation from the inside. Devers is met by Ammel Brodrig, Emperor Cleon II's Privy Secretary who was sent by the Emperor to Riose in order to keep an eye on the general. Devers tries to implicate Riose in an attempt to overthrow Cleon. However, Brodrig betrays Devers to Riose. Barr knocks out Riose before he can subject Devers to more effective interrogation and Devers and Barr escape in the latter's ship. Barr confesses to Devers that he cooperated with Riose in order to prevent the discovery of a planned Siwennian uprising in the event of the Foundation's triumph over Riose. Devers and Barr head to Trantor in a last ditch attempt at turning Cleon II against Riose by implicating the latter in a conspiracy to overthrow the former with the help of Brodrig. However, in their attempt to bribe their way up the chain of bureaucracy, they are caught in the act by a member of the Secret Police, but manage to flee the planet before they are arrested. During their escape, they intercept news of Bel Riose and Brodrig's recall and subsequent arrest for treason (both are later said to have been executed), which leads to Siwenna's rebellion and the end of the threat to the Foundation. During the festivities celebrating Siwenna joining the Foundation, Barr explains to Devers and the Foundation's top merchant prince Sennet Forell that the social background of the Empire made the Foundation's victory inevitable regardless of what actions they and Bel Riose took, as only a strong Emperor and a strong general could have threatened the Foundation, but an Emperor is only strong by not allowing strong subjects to thrive, and Bel Riose's success made him into a threat that Cleon II needed to eliminate. With the Empire nearing its end and the Second Foundation not expected to be met until centuries later, the Foundation anticipates no further opposition. However, an internal conflict between the Foundation's merchant princes and the traders is foreshadowed. The characters of Emperor Cleon II and Bel Riose in this story are based on those of the historical Roman Emperor Justinian I and his general Belisarius. Their story was familiar to Asimov from his recent reading of Robert Graves's novel Count Belisarius, and of his earlier study of Edward Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, on which the entire series is loosely based. \"The General\" was first published in the April 1945 issue of Astounding Science Fiction under the title \"Dead Hand.\" \n",
      "The Mule\n",
      " The second half of the book, titled \"The Mule,\" takes place approximately one hundred years after the first half. The Empire, after its final phase of decline and civil war, has ceased to exist, Trantor has suffered \"The Great Sack\" by a \"barbarian fleet,\" and only a small rump state of 20 agricultural planets remain. Most of galactic civilization has disintegrated into barbaric kingdoms. The Foundation has become the dominant power in the galaxy, controlling its territory through its trading network. The outline of the Seldon Plan has become widely known, and Foundationists and many others believe that as it has accurately predicted previous events, the Foundation's formation of a Second Empire is inevitable. The leadership of the Foundation has become dictatorial and complacent, and many outer planets belonging to the Traders plan to revolt. An external threat arises in the form of a mysterious man known only as the Mule. The Mule (whose real name is never revealed) is a mutant, and possesses the ability to sense and manipulate the emotions of others, usually creating fear and/or total devotion within his victims. He uses this ability to take over the independent systems bordering the Foundation, and has them wage a war against it. In face of this new threat, the provincial Traders join with the central Foundation leaders against the Mule, believing him to be the new Seldon crisis. As the Mule advances, the Foundation's leaders assume that Seldon predicted this attack, and that the scheduled hologram crisis message appearance of Seldon will again tell them how to win. To their surprise, they learn that Seldon predicted a civil war with the Traders, not the rise of the Mule. The tape suddenly stops as Terminus loses all power in a Mule attack, and the Foundation falls. Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell, along with the psychologist Ebling Mis and \"Magnifico Giganticus,\" a clown fleeing the Mule's service, travel to different worlds of the Foundation, and finally to the Great Library of Trantor. The Darells and Mis seek to contact the Second Foundation, which they believe will be able to defeat the Mule. They also have suspicions that the Mule wishes to know the location of the Second Foundation as well, so that he can use the First Foundation's technology to destroy it. At the Great Library, Ebling Mis works continuously until his health fatally deteriorates. As Mis lies dying, he tells Toran, Bayta, and Magnifico that he knows where the Second Foundation is. Before he can reveal the Second Foundation's location, however, Bayta kills him. Bayta had realized, shortly before, that Magnifico was actually the Mule, who had used his powers in every planet they had previously visited. In the same way, he had forced Mis to continue working and find what the Mule was looking for. Bayta had killed Mis to prevent him from revealing the Second Foundation's whereabouts to the Mule. The Darells are left on Trantor. The Mule leaves to reign over the Foundation and the rest of his new empire. The existence of the Second Foundation, as an organization centered on the science of psychology and mentalics, in contrast to the Foundation's focus on physical sciences, is now known to the Darells and the Mule. Now that the Mule has conquered the Foundation, he stands as the most powerful force in the galaxy, and the Second Foundation is the only threat to his eventual reign over the entire galaxy. The Mule promises that he will find the Second Foundation, while Bayta asserts that it has already prepared for him and thus that he will not have enough time before the Second Foundation reacts. \"The Mule\" was first published under that title in the November and December 1945 issues of Astounding Science Fiction. \n",

      "History\n",
      " Food for Life as a project was initially inspired by an elderly Indian Swami, known as A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder-Acharya of ISKCON. In 1974 when watching a group of village children fighting with street dogs over scraps of food, the Swami was shocked and told his students, \"No one within ten miles of our temple should go hungry... I want you to begin serving food immediately.\"History of Food for Life In response to his plea, members of ISKCON and volunteers around the world were inspired to expand that original effort into a global network of kitchens, cafes, vans, and mobile services, all providing free food, and establishing daily delivery routes in many large cities around the world. Since that day, Food for Life has grown into the world’s largest vegan food relief. The distribution of sanctified plant-based meals has been and will continue to be an essential part of India’s Vedic culture of hospitality from which Food for Life was born.

Until now, philosophies on healthy living and nutrition have focused on the mechanics of health and happiness, exclusively focusing on the body alone. In doing so, these philosophies have promoted practices and diets that, in one way or another, have alienated vast numbers of people. As a result, despite volumes of literature and research, there is no consensus on the best diet or mode of living. They have all failed to identify one underlying truth that connects us all and from which all health systems can be reconciled and/or elevated to their ultimate stature. That truth is: our constitutional nature is spirit and we are all spiritually equal. Any healthy living program, therefore, needs to address the “nutritional” needs of the body, mind, and spirit. \n",

Golan Trevize, a former officer of the Navy and now a member of Council, believes the Second Foundation, which is almost universally thought to be extinct, still exists and is controlling events.

      "answer: title: Genes to Cognition Project\n",
      "Genes to Cognition (G2C) is a neuroscience research programme that studies genes, the brain and behaviour in an integrated manner. It is engaged in a large-scale investigation of the function of molecules found at the synapse. This is mainly focused on proteins that interact with the NMDA receptor, a receptor for the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which is required for processes of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP). One key discovery that led to the G2C project was the characterization of a group of proteins that interact with this receptor, called the \"NMDA Receptor Complex (NRC)\" and the observation that dysfunctions of many of these proteins are characteristic of numerous diseases of the nervous system.Proteomic analysis of NMDA receptor-adhesion protein signaling complexes. Nature Neuroscience 3, 661-669 (2000) The NRC contains 185 proteins, 48 of which have so far been implicated in 54 human nervous system disorders.Synapse proteomics of multiprotein complexes: en route from genes to nervous system diseases. Human Molecular Genetics 14, R225-R234. The molecular evolution of the NRC is also an active area of research, and it has been shown that an increase in the complexity of these signaling proteins at synapses has evolved alongside the enhanced cognitive capacities of humans and other higher vertebrates.Evolutionary expansion and anatomical specialization of synapse proteome complexity. Nature Neuroscience 11, 799 - 806 (2008) \n",
      "Scientific Strategy\n",
      " The activities of the Genes to Cognition Project encompass a wide range of scientific specialisms, reflecting the diversity of information that must be integrated to advance understanding of the brain. Following from synapse proteomics experiments to identify candidate proteins for further investigation, G2C has undertaken to knock out many of these by gene targeting in mice and has established a number of high-throughput platforms for evaluating the effect of these genetic manipulations on brain function. \n",
      "Information Sharing\n",
      " As well as sharing findings through open access articles in the scientific literature, Genes to Cognition maintains a database, G2Cdb and an educational web site, G2Conline. \n",
      "G2Cdb: Genes to Cognition Database\n",
      " G2Cdb integrates information curated from the scientific literature and numerous online databases about genes and diseases of interest to Genes to Cognition.G2Cdb: the Genes to Cognition database. Nucleic Acids Research. 37(Database issue):D846-51 (2009) It also provides access to lists of genes derived from proteomics experiments characterising the composition of the complex of proteins present at the postsynaptic density. It will also provide data from experiments investigating the effects of genetic manipulation of these synaptic molecules. \n",
      "G2Conline: Educational Web Site\n",
      " G2Conline is an interactive educational website that provides extensive background information on key topics in neuroscience and brain disorders. There are many video clips of interviews with scientists, including Nobel laureates James Watson and Eric Kandel. \n",

      "Molecular cellular cognition (MCC) is a branch of neuroscience that involves the study of cognitive processes with approaches that integrate molecular, cellular and behavioral mechanisms. Key goals of MCC studies include the derivation of molecular and cellular explanations of cognitive processes, as well as finding mechanisms and treatments for cognitive disorders. Although closely connected with behavioral genetics, MCC emphasizes the integration of molecular and cellular explanations of behavior, instead of focusing on the connections between genes and behavior. Unlike cognitive neuroscience, which historically has focused on the connection between human brain systems and behavior, the field of MCC has used model organisms, such as mice, to study how molecular (i.e. receptor, kinase activation, phosphatase regulation), intra-cellular (i.e. dendritic processes), and inter-cellular processes (i.e. synaptic plasticity; network representations such as place \n",

      "similar 1: Cognitive genomics\n",
      "Cognitive genomics (or neurative genomics) is the sub-field of genomics pertaining to cognitive function in which the genes and non-coding sequences of an organism's genome related to the health and activity of the brain are studied. By applying comparative genomics, the genomes of multiple species are compared in order to identify genetic and phenotypical differences between species. Observed phenotypical characteristics related to the neurological function include behavior, personality, neuroanatomy, and neuropathology. The theory behind cognitive genomics is based on elements of genetics, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, cognitive psychology, behavioral psychology, and neurophysiology. Intelligence is the most extensively studied behavioral trait. In humans, approximately 70% of all genes are expressed in the brain. Genetic variation accounts for 40% of phenotypical variation. Approaches in cognitive genomics have been used to investigate the genetic cause\n",

      "The Generalist Genes Hypothesis of learning abilities and disabilities was originally coined in an article by Plomin & Kovas (2005). The Generalist Genes Hypothesis suggests that most genes associated with common learning disabilities and abilities are generalist in three ways. *Firstly, the same genes that influence common learning abilities (e.g., high reading aptitude) are also responsible for common learning disabilities (e.g., reading disability): they are strongly genetically correlated. *Secondly, many of the genes associated with one aspect of a learning disability (e.g., vocabulary problems) also influence other aspects of this learning disability (e.g., grammar problems). *Thirdly, genes that influence one learning disability (e.g., reading disability) are largely the same as those that influence other learning disabilities (e.g., mathematics disability). The Generalist Genes Hypothesis has important implications for education, cognitive sciences a\n"
