Libre was founded in 2011 by the National Popular Resistance Front (FNRP), a leftist coalition of organizations opposed to the 2009 coup. Xiomara Castro, the wife of former president Manuel Zelaya who was deposed in the 2009 coup, was the presidential candidate of the party in the 2013 presidential election; Zelaya was not allowed to run for a second term under the constitution. Castro took second place in the four-way race, receiving approximately 29 percent of the vote behind Juan Orlando Hernández's 34 percent. Castro has stated that if she won the 2021 presidential election, she would promote democratic socialism and ask the National Congress to draft a new constitution. At least eighteen Libre pre- candidates, candidates, family members, and campaign leaders were killed between June 2012 and October 2013.

      "Varela Project[SEP]The Varela Project () is a project that was started in 1998 by Oswaldo Payá of the Christian Liberation Movement (MCL) and named after Felix Varela, a Cuban religious leader. Many members were imprisoned during the Black Spring in 2003. ==The Varela Project citizens' initiative== The purpose of the Varela Project was to circulate a proposal of law advocating for democratic political reforms within Cuba, such as the establishment of freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, free elections, freedom of religion, freedom to start private businesses, and amnesty for political prisoners. About 11,000 Cubans signed the reformist Varela Project citizens' initiative.David Altman, Direct Democracy Worldwide (Cambridge University Press), 2011), p. 112. The US State Department's 2005 report on Cuba in Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (issued in 2006) stated that \"activists reported increased harassment by State Security agents. Authorities arrested and detained Varela activists, confiscated signatures, fined and threatened activists and signers, and forced signers to rescind signatures. State Security impersonated canvassing volunteers and increasingly infiltrated the ranks of activists. In May and June, Oswaldo Paya reported State Security agents visited and pressured more than 50 Varela Project signatories to retract their signatures and denounce the Varela Project activists who had collected their signatures.\" The US State Department's 2004 report on Cuba referred to the Cuban Penal Code concept of \"dangerousness,\" defined as the \"special proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by his conduct in manifest contradiction of socialist norms.\" The report said that \"If the police decide that a person exhibits signs of dangerousness, they may bring the offender before a court or subject him to therapy or political reeducation\". According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, this provision \"amounted to a subjective criterion used by the Government to justify violations of individual freedoms and due process for persons whose sole crime was to hold a view different from the official view\". The Cuban government refused to consider the petition, and the Cuban National Assembly's Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee suspended its consideration, and responded to the Varela Project with a \"counter-initiative\" to enshrine \"irrevocable socialism\" in the Cuban Constitution. The BBC reported that, over a two-week period, 9 million Cubans took to the streets and 99% of all Cuban citizens signed a petition endorsing the constitutional amendment. The BBC said that many Cubans felt pressured into signing the government's petition. An extraordinary session of the National Assembly unanimously approved the amendment in June 2002. The government closed schools, offices, and factory during the session, and nationally televised the speeches; no mention was made of the Varela Project citizens' initiative during the event. ==Support for Varela Project== The Cuban exile community in the United States was split on the Varela Project. Many hard-liners opposed the project out of fears that a reformist proposal would legitimize the Castro regime, and a radio commentator at Radio Mambi said that he was fired for publicly supporting the project. The Cuban American National Foundation under Jorge Mas Santos, supported the Varela Project.David Adams, Cuban exiles bend toward reform, Tapa Bay Times (August 31, 2005). The Varela Project was lauded by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter when he made a historic visit to Havana in May 2002 and gave a televised address broadcast throughout Cuba.Cuban dissident collects EU prize, BBC News (December 17, 2002).Kevin Sullivan, Carter Urges Democracy for Cuba, Washington Post (May 15, 2002). The European Union awarded Payá the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in December 2002. ==Black Spring (2003)== The Cuban government dismissed the Varela Project and its petition. The Cuban government said that the project was part of a \"counterrevolutionary\" plot and \"strategy of subversion against Cuba\" orchestrated by the United States and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. In March 2003, Cuba arrested 75 human rights activists and dissidents, including 25 members of the Varela Project, on a variety of charges. The dissidents were sentenced in public trials to prison terms of between 6 and 28 years for \"mercenary activities and other acts against the independence or territorial integrity of the state\". Amnesty International said it was concerned that the 75 jailed activists may be prisoners of conscience who were imprisoned for their non-violent advocacy for democracy. According to the US State Department, many of those arrested had no access to attorneys until the day of their trial, which was by a judge subordinate to the Communist Party. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern regarding the arrests and summary trials. The US State Department said \"Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia, a Varela Project leader and one of the 75 activists arrested in March 2003, reported serving 45 days in a punishment cell for protesting the suspension of correspondence and the delivery of food and medical supplies from his family. He did not receive food or water during the first 3 days of his confinement and slept on a cement floor. Authorities confiscated his Bible and prohibited any contact with other prisoners. Ferrer was serving a 25 year sentence for \"acts against the independence or the territorial integrity of the State.\"\" According to the US State Department, \"Fabio Prieto Llorente, one of the 75 activists arrested in March 2003, reported he was held in a small cell with leaky walls and a cement slab for a bed. The cell was infested with rats, frogs, and insects\". The US State Department said \"Yarai Reyes, wife of Normando Hernandez Gonzalez, 1 of the 75 political prisoners arrested in March 2003, reported that prison authorities incited common prisoners to beat her husband\". According to the US State Department \"Barbara Rojo Arias, wife of Omar Ruiz Hernandez, an independent journalist and 1 of the 75 human rights activists arrested in March 2003, reported that her husband was denied access to required medications for his heart condition and stomach problems. The US State Department said \"Oscar Espinosa Chepe, a political prisoner released during the year, reported that prison officials regularly denied him adequate medical treatment during his 20-month incarceration\". The US State Department said that Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet \"was sent to a punishment cell for refusing to eat in the prison cafeteria, wear the uniform of common prisoners, and stand at attention when guards entered his cell. He was not permitted to read, write, or leave his cell to get exercise. In addition, prison authorities refused to accept food and medical supplies brought by Morejon or permit anyone to bring him food. As a result, Biscet found himself on a virtual hunger strike\". ==References== Category:1998 in Cuba Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Cuba Category:Cuban dissidents Category:Society of Cuba Category:Human rights organizations based in Cuba Category:Nonviolent resistance movements\n",

The government imprisoned 75 dissidents, including 29 journalists, as well as librarians, human rights activists, and democracy activists, on the basis that they were acting as agents of the United States by accepting aid from the US government. Although Amnesty International adopted 75 Cubans as prisoners of conscience, according to Cuba \"the 75 individuals arrested, tried and sentenced in March/April 2003 ... who were jailed are demonstrably not independent thinkers, writers or human rights activists, but persons directly in the pay of the US government ... those who were arrested and tried were charged not with criticizing the government, but for receiving American government funds and collaborating with U.S diplomats.\" The crackdown on grassroots activists began on 18 March and lasted two days, coordinated with the US invasion of Iraq for minimum publicity. The crackdown received sharp international condemnation, with critical statements coming from the George W. Bush administration, the European Union, the United Nations and various human rights groups, including Amnesty International. Responding to the crackdown, the European Union imposed sanctions on Cuba in 2003, that were lifted in January 2008. The European Union declared that the arrests \"constituted a breach of the most elementary human rights, especially as regards freedom of expression and political association\". All of the dissidents were eventually released, most of whom were exiled to Spain starting in 2010. == Imprisoned people == thumb|Demonstrators holding up signs of imprisoned people during the Black Spring Manuel Vázquez Portal received the International Press Freedom Award in 2003.

      "Havana Presidential Palace attack (1957)[SEP]The 1957 Havana Presidential Palace attack was a failed assassination attempt on the life of President Fulgencio Batista at the Presidential Palace in Havana, Cuba. The attack began at around 3:30 PM on March 13, 1957, carried out by Menelao Mora, a group of members of the Partido Auténtico, and the student opposition group Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo, but was unsuccessful in its goal of killing Batista. According to one of the group's founding members, Faure Chomón, they were following the golpe arriba strategy and sought to overthrow the government by killing Batista. The same day, a similar attack occurred at the Radio Reloj at the Radiocentro CMQ Building. http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/1957/St_Louis_Post_Dispatch-3-13-1957-1.pdf The plan was to announce Batista's death over Radio Reloj; however, this attack also failed. ==Attack== The plan of attack, as explained by Faure Chomón Mediavilla, was to secure the Presidential Palace by a commando of fifty men (46 participated) and simultaneously support the operation by one hundred men occupying the radio station Radio Reloj at the Radiocentro CMQ Building to announce the death of Batista. The attack on the palace would result in the elimination of Fulgencio Batista. === Presidential Palace attack === At 3:40 pm, the main assault force arrived before the main entrance to the Presidential Palace in two sedans and a delivery truck. They were armed with rifles, submachine guns, pistols, and grenades. All were in shirtsleeves for identification, since suits or uniforms were required for persons within the palace. Twelve government soldiers on guard at the entrance were shot or scattered. Of the 46 attackers, nine were able to reach the second floor of the east wing of the palace, about ten were shot down in the open area before the building and the remainder occupied part of the ground floor. The palace switchboard was disabled with a grenade. Batista's office on the third floor was reached by a group of the rebel force and two of his guards were killed near his desk. Batista himself had retreated to the presidential suite on the top floor where the palace defenders rallied and fired on the attackers both within the palace and the forecourt below. At this point military and police reinforcements arrived while tanks were summoned. The rebels within the palace were forced to retreat, some being killed on the main staircase. Only three escaped the building. The main assault force was to be supported by a group of 100 armed men who would occupy the tallest buildings in the surrounding area of the Presidential Palace (La Tabacalera, the Sevilla Hotel, the Palace of Fine Arts) and, from these positions, support the main force. However, this secondary support operation was not carried out as the militants assigned to capture the buildings hesitated and did not arrive. The attackers spoke in code to frustrate a potential infiltration or a divulging of the attack in any conversation. It had been agreed early on that they would refer to the palace as \"la casa de los tres kilos.\" Although the attackers reached the third floor of the palace, they did not locate or harm Batista. === Radio Reloj attack === thumb|310px|Bullet holes in glass at the Radiocentro CMQ Building The attack at Radio Reloj, located in the Radiocentro CMQ Building at Calle 23 and L in El Vedado, was led by José Antonio Echeverría who was accompanied among others, by Fructuoso Rodríguez, Joe Westbrook, Raúl Diaz Argüelles, and Julio García Olivera. The group departed from a basement apartment located on Calle 19 between Calles B and C towards the Radiocentro CMQ Building in three automobiles, including a delivery truck. At 3:21 PM on March 13, 1957, José Antonio arrived at Radio Reloj and after being announced, read a prepared statement over the radio, announcing Batista's death despite that such an event had not actually happened. > \"People of Cuba, in these moments the dictator Fulgencio Batista has just > been justified. In his own burrow of the Presidential Palace, the people of > Cuba have come to settle accounts. And it is we, the Revolutionary > Directory, who in the name of the Cuban Revolution have given the shot of > grace to this regime of opprobrium. Cubans listening to me.

José Antonio was shot and killed by police on the corner of November 27 and L, on his way back to the university. Otto Hernández Fernández, the last survivor of the Radio Reloj attack, recalled the events: ===Casualties=== left|thumb|The delivery truck used by the attackers Twenty of the 100 members of Batista's presidential guard were killed. Forty-two rebels participated in the attack against the palace; 34 were from the Partido Autentico, and the rest were from the Student Directory.

Surviving the attack were Angel Eros, Amador Silveriño (driver of the \"Fast Delivery\" truck.), Orlando Manrique, Orlando Lamadrid Velazco, Sergio Pereda Velazco, Santiago Aguero, Manuel Toranzo, Ricardo Olmedo (injured during attack; later shot for attempting to kill Fidel Castro), 40, Faure Chomón, Antonio Castell Valdes, Juan Gualberto Valdes, José M.

Two individuals were under arrest to be tried: Orlando Olmedo Moreno, wounded during the attack, and Efrain Alfonso Liriano. All others connected with the attack either escaped or were killed. === Public Act of Redress === thumb|right|300px|Batista supporters at the public act of redress, April 7, 1957 The public act of redress by the people of Havana for the assault of March 13 on the Presidential Palace took place on April 7, 1957. It was reported that more than 250,000 people attended. === Golpeando Arriba === On January 22, 1959, Fidel Castro explained to journalists gathered in the Copa Room of the Havana Riviera hotel, among other topics, that hitting up, \"golpear arriba,\" was one of the \"false concepts about the revolution\" because \"tyranny is not a man; tyranny is a system (...) We were never supporters of tyrannicide or military coups, [which tended] to inculcate the people a complex of impotence \" A few months earlier Castro had reprimanded Guevara for having signed a pact with Rolando Cubela, Chomon's lieutenant in the DR-13-3 guerrilla in Escambray mountains, the \"Pacto del Pedrero\". The letter is dated in Palma Soriano on December 26, 1958; part of it reads: === Humboldt 7 massacre === The failure of the attacks led to a widespread police crackdown on anti-Batista militants, often involving extrajudicial killings of revolutionaries, regardless of whether they were armed or fighting back. On April 20, 1957, four unarmed DRE revolutionaries who were previously involved in the attack were shot and killed by Havana police as they attempted to flee their apartment safehouse during a raid. The event led to widespread criticism of the police and, after the revolution, resulted in the arrest, trial and execution (1964) of Marcos Rodriguez (Marquitos), another revolutionary who betrayed the four men. ==See also== * Humboldt 7 massacre * Radiocentro CMQ Building * Presidential Palace * Directorio Revolucionario 13 de Marzo * Faure Chomón * José Antonio Echeverría * Rolando Cubela Secades * Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo == Notes == == References == ==Additional reading== :Attack on the Presidential Palace (March 13, 1957) ==External links== :Cuando los universitarios se levantaron contra el gobernante de Cuba (FOTOS) :Revolt in Havana.

      "Alberto Rodriguez (FALN)[SEP]Alberto Rodriguez was a Puerto Rican member of the FALN who received a sentence of 35 years for seditious conspiracy and other charges. He was sentenced in 1985, and incarcerated first at United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg (USP Lewisberg), PA, and later at the federal penitentiary at USP Beaumont, TX. However, he was released early from prison, after President Bill Clinton extended a clemency offer in August 1999. Alberto and 10 other Puerto Rican prisoners were released on September 10, 1999.\"12 Imprisoned Puerto Ricans Accept Clemency Conditions\" by John M. Broder. The New York Times September 8, 1999 ==Early years and personal life== Alberto was born in 1953 in Bronx, New York and was raised in Chicago. While he was in high school he became part of a new generation of Puerto Ricans in the United States who demanded that their history and culture be recognized and joined the Puerto Rican Independence Movement. In the early 1970s Puerto Rican students were using the tactics of sit-ins and civil disobedience, to force the Chicago Board of Education to be more responsive to the needs of Latino students. Alberto entered the University of Illinois, Chicago in 1972, and immediately became involved in student struggles for a Latin American studies program and for recruitment of Latino students. Upon graduation in 1976 he began to work for community programs, such as the Borinqueña Learning Center, which provided opportunities for working adults to pursue educational goals. He also worked in various community organizations including the Workers Rights Center, El Comite Pro-Orientacion Comunal, El Desfile del Pueblo, Latino Cultural Center and the Puerto Rican Cultural Center. At the time of his arrest he was married and the father of two children. ==Seditious conspiracy== When arrested in 1983 Alberto was working as an academic counselor at Northeastern Illinois University and was completing his thesis requirements for a graduate degree from Governors State University. He was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to 35 years. Rodriguez and three others were arrested in various locations around Chicago on June 29, 1983. Alberto Rodriguez, Edwin Cortes and Jose Luis Rodriguez were given a $10 million bond while Alejandrina Torres was given a $5 million bond. His first ten months in prison were in solitary confinement, where, he says, \"I had to search within myself to find the spiritual strength to persevere.\" A federal judge found the conditions of confinement too harsh and ordered the federal prison to place both Alberto Rodriguez and Edwin Cortes in general population though in special restrictive conditions. A series of arrests against purported FALN members began in 1977 and culminated around 1985. Rodriguez was never charged with any bombings. During the trial proceedings from 1983 through 1985, he declared his status as prisoner of war, and refused to participate in the proceedings.Prendergast, Alan. End of the Line. Denver Westword, July 12, 1995. Retrieved on November 21, 2008 Alberto Rodriguez was given a 35-year federal sentence for seditious conspiracy and other charges. Among the other convicted Puerto Rican nationalists there were sentences of as long as 90 years in Federal prisons for offenses including seditious conspiracy, possession of unregistered firearms, interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by violence and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a crime. None of those granted clemency were convicted in any of the actual bombings, including Rodriguez. Rather, they had been convicted on a variety of conspiracy charges ranging from conspiracy to make bombs, conspiracy to armed robbery and various firearms violations. They were all convicted for seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to oppose the authority of the Government of the United States in Puerto Rico by force. ==Political prisoner== At the time of their arrest Rodriguez and the others declared themselves to be combatants in an anti-colonial war against the United States to liberate Puerto Rico from U.S. domination and invoked prisoner of war status. They argued that the U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction to try them as criminals and petitioned for their cases to be handed over to an international court that would determine their status. The U.S. Government, however, did not recognize their request. The sentences received by Rodriguez and the other Nationalists were judged to be \"out of proportion to the nationalists' offenses.\" Statistics showed their sentences were almost 20 times greater than sentences for similar offenses by the American population at large. For many years, numerous national and international organizations criticized Rodriguez' incarceration categorizing it as political imprisonment. Peoples Law Office. Puerto Rico. Alberto Rodriguez was finally released from prison on September 10, 1999, after President Bill Clinton extended him clemency. Clinton cited Rev. Desmond Tutu and former President Jimmy Carter as having been influential on his decision to grant Rodriguez the clemency offer. Cases involving the release of other Puerto Rican Nationalist prisoners have also been categorized as cases of political prisoners, with someUnited Nations General Assembly.

In the struggle for the independence of Peru, the hero acted as secret emissary carrying messages between the Government of Callao and Lima Patriots by swimming. He was discovered, arrested and subjected to torture and sentenced to death. Despite the torture, he never revealed his mission and willingly swallowed the letters assigned to the mission. The independence of Peru, first declared in Huaura in November 1820 and July 28, 1821 in Lima, had become effective only in Lima and in the north, but Cuzco, the central highlands and south were still under the rule of the royal army. When José de San Martín recognized the little support given to political and military forces, he resigned from the Constituent Congress of Peru, 1822. The congress appointed José de la Riva Agüero as President of the Republic and Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro as Congress President. The royal army, taking advantage of the fact that the patriotic troops were far away, took Lima and members of Congress took refuge in the Real Felipe Fortress in Callao. It is at this stage that José Olaya, a fisherman by trade, did not hesitate to serve as a link between the ships of the squadron Liberator (formed by units of the Republic of Chile) and the soldiers of the patriotic forces (Argentina, Chile and Peru) located in Lima, even if it meant walking across fields and swimming in the sea. Imprisoned by the royal army, he was tortured in order to obtain information about the patriotic forces. José Olaya Balandra was not frightened of pain. He suffered two hundred lashes of the whip and two hundred beatings with sticks, not yielding even after they tore out his nails.

      "Oscar Espinosa Chepe[SEP]Óscar Manuel Espinosa Chepe (November 29, 1940 – September 23, 2013) was a Cuban economist and dissident. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested, tried and convicted in 2003 as part of a crackdown by the Cuban government nicknamed the \"Black Spring\". He was given a twenty-year sentence on a charge of \"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\", causing Amnesty International to declare him as a prisoner of conscience. ==Background== Espinosa was a graduate of the University of Havana, where he received a degree in economics. He served on Prime Minister Fidel Castro's Economic Advisory Group from 1965 to 1968 before spending fourteen years as the economic adviser at the Cuban embassy in Belgrade, overseeing Cuba's economic and technological cooperation with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. In 1984, he returned to Cuba to work at the National Bank, where he was responsible for trade and tourism. However, throughout the 1980s, Espinosa increasingly disagreed with national economic policy. When he discussed his views with a colleague in 1992, he was demoted, and four years later was fired. Espinosa began to write critiques of Cuban economic policy which he published overseas. He also hosted a radio program titled Charlando con Chepe (\"Chatting with Chepe\") in which he discussed the Cuban economy; the program was carried on the U.S.-funded station Radio Martí. Espinosa was married to independent Cuban journalist Miriam Leiva. ==Arrest and trial== On March 19, 2003, Espinosa was arrested during the Black Spring after security agents reportedly spent 10 hours searching his apartment. At a trial on April 3, 2003, Espinosa was accused of \"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\". Authorities stated that Espinosa had received money from the U.S. government, and that US$13,600 had been discovered sewn into one of his jackets. Espinosa was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested and tried. Following a rejected appeal by Espinosa, the Representative of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Christine Chanet, appealed to President Castro to pardon him. The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush appealed to Castro on Espinosa's behalf, calling on the government to provide treatment for his liver disease. A spokesman described the Cuban government as \"going out of its way\" to be inhumane to its prisoners. Espinosa's wife Leiva reported that he had lost forty pounds since his arrest and was kept in a cell with no windows or running water. Leiva became active in the Ladies in White, a group of wives of political prisoners which marched through Havana each Sunday protesting their husbands' detention. She continued to march even after Espinosa's early release. == Release == Espinosa was released from prison along with fellow writer Raúl Rivero on November 29, 2004, after serving just over 19 months of his prison sentence; It was his sixty-fourth birthday. The authorities granted him medical parole because his already poor health had declined seriously during his incarceration. After his release, he called on the government to release the remaining Black Spring prisoners, stating, \"The government really committed a very big error with us. We are completely peaceful and we want only the reconciliation of Cuban society.\" In 2006, Espinosa stated his opposition to U.S. funding for the Cuban dissident movement, calling it \"counterproductive\" and stating that the Cuban people must solve its own problems. Following Raúl Castro's assumption of the presidency, Espinosa expressed his hope that Castro could be the Deng Xiaoping of Cuba, improving the economy and the standard of living. ==Death== He died of liver disease on September 23, 2013, in Spain. ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Cuba Category:Cuban democracy activists Category:Cuban dissidents Category:Cuban economists Category:Cuban journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:University of Havana alumni Category:Deaths from liver disease Category:Cuban prisoners and detainees\n",

A few days before the coup, in February 1976, Hansen's house blew up with another bomb. At the end of 1976,while she was at home with her three children and another person,Eduardo Carafa who was an engineer, and came there for legal works. the Army stopped her car while she wants to go out with her family early in the morning. They were taken in assault cars. They were left her three children in the yard. The oldest was 10 years old at that time. At the Police Headquarters they entered through San Lorenzo Street, and the Fiat that brought it turned left, until it reached the corner of Dorrego. She was bandaged, taken to a place in the clandestine detention center of the Information Service Where she heard crafa's screamed and his torture who was released after 20 days with broken ribs and her eyes damaged by the electric prod. Olga was questioned among others, the police inspector Rosario Agustín Feced and José Rubén Lofiego (known as the blind man), who was the one who armed the information. They put her in a hallway. She spent several days in that place, where she constantly listened to how she was tortured. A few days later, after several interrogations, they went to the basement. At that moment they released her sight. Her eyes burned, because the bandages had been made with posters that were painted with lime. ===Solidarity between peers=== The women who were there receive it, help it, clean it, contain it. Among others were Ana Maria Ferrari, Graciela Villarreal, Roxana Colombo and Adriana Koatz. They took Ana Ferrari every night, they put her up, a Sergeant Vergara was looking for her and they tortured her, the oppressors were particularly angry with Ferrari. Graciela Villarreal was also terribly tortured. Adriana Koatz, was a student of chemical engineering and was a member of the Peronist University Youth when she was arrested on October 21, 1976 and taken to the Information Service. From there she suffered a string of blows, tortures, vexations. She recalls that she shared captivity in the basement with Ester Fernández, Graciela Villarreal, Ana María Ferrari, Olga Cabrera Hansen, among others. Among men she remembers Pérez Risso and Piccolo. She was then referred to Villa Devoto where her father gave her the news that her sister Edith Graciela Koatz had been murdered along with her husband Palmiro Labrador Pérez. After a massive transfer of female detainees to the prisons of Devoto and of men to Coronda, few remained in the basement of the Jefatura. They took them to the Warden. Olga is there until September 1977, without seeing the light or leaving. ===The visit of the International Red Cross=== It happened in February 1977. When the delegation began to ask, Olga could not contain herself. Everyone was silent but she could not and said everything: \"No judge knows I'm here, and this is two blocks from the courthouse, we do not see the sun, we do not have visitors, here we just torture and kill people.\" Afterwards, they told him that he could have left at that moment, but for everything he had said he was going to stay two more years. So it was. ==Testimony== In 2010 began in the Federal Courts, the second oral and public trial for crimes against humanity committed during the last military civic dictatorship in the area of the Great Rosary, in the case known as Diaz Bessone (ex \"Causa Feced).DIAZ BESSONE The case \"Díaz Bessone\" has as imputed a soldier and five civilians, who are accused of carrying out the repression in the clandestine center of the Information section of the Police Headquarters, considered the most important that worked in the city. in the cause are the former commander of the Second Army Corps, Ramón Díaz Bessone, and former policemen Rubén Lofiego, Mario Marcote, Ramón Vergara, José Scortechini and Ricardo Chomicky, the heart of the repressive apparatus that acted under the orders of the deceased former head of the Rosario Police, Agustín Feced. In November 2010, Olga testified in front of the Federal Oral Court: she was not another witness, but someone who embodies the very history of the cause that investigates State terrorism in the region. He recalled that the then chaplain of the police, Eugenio Zitelli, defended the torture in front of detainees. In general, they had all been raped, since it was a systematic practice of the detention center and he recalled that some of the compañeras who were Catholic, asked for spiritual assistance, were frightened by what the priest told them. He justified torture as something to obtain information, but the violation if it outraged him, said that it was immoral. In January 1977, the door opened and María Inés Luchetti de Bettanín arrived with a newborn baby, for whom neither I even had clothes. Among the detainees they made an improvised trousseau with pieces of their own clothes. In addition to pointing to Feced and Lofiego, Olga remembered the presence of Ramón Rito Vergara, aka the Sergeant, in the basement of the SI. In a train to unveil the network of complicities, he mentioned the close relations between his official defender, Laura Cosidoy and Major Fernando Soria, in charge of the war council simulacra in the Second Army Corps Command. One of the most shocking moments was when she told of a detainee, María de la Encarnación García del Villar de Tapia, who had been terribly tortured. She herself told him a dialogue between Lofiego and Feced when they threw her to the side, after the torments. \"He saw commander, how women have a degree of tolerance,\" El Ciego told his superior. He also remembered the Swift workers, among whom there were three pregnant women. From Luisa Marciani, she said she was 40 years old, she was full term and she felt very bad. Despite the pressure of the detainees, they delayed their attention. Gladis, the daughter of Luisa, 18, who had been tortured to the point of smashing her heels, was also detained there. \"The warders come, they call her daughter and they say to her: 'Your mom died and the baby is dead too, do not even think about crying.' That was Tita's death.\" In another eloquent passage of his statement, he described how repression operated on the workers. For example, a whole section of Fader workers was brought in, they were beaten terribly. Some went to Coronda and others ran, but chastened. There were combined actions with Somisa entrepreneurs. He recalled how companies changed the credentials of their workers, updated the photos, and it was those same credentials that led the task forces to kidnap them. The witness also saw the detainees Perez Risso and Piccolo, very hurt. \"Pérez Risso had a broken arm, and Piccolo had a hole in his head,\" he said. ==Activity in the legal field== Olga Cabrera Hansen is one of the people who worked most, from the legal field, for the reconstruction of what happened in the Information Service of the Rosario police during the dictatorship, the place where the clandestine detention center was set up largest in the province of Santa Fe and where she was detained. When she was released, in 1978, she was not paralyzed. She approached the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights and began to tie things together, relate relatives of the disappeared with former detainees, to reconstruct the courses in what she called yesterday \"that sinister puzzle\". Together with her colleague, Delia Rodríguez Araya, they investigated complaints and gave form to the Feced case, which began in January 1984 in the provincial courts. Until 1979, when she started working at APDH, the agencies limited themselves to receiving requests from relatives and processing habeas corpus that always had negative results. One day, the witness was with Delia, and three young women arrived asking about their sister, María Sol Pérez Losada. \"Did she suffer from the kidneys?\" Olga asked. It was like that, then, she told them to go to Buenos Aires to talk to two detainees who had been with her. \"With that anecdotal fact the entire chain of denunciations began,\" the lawyer recalled yesterday. ==Documentary film== Rosario de Galtieri.

Thanking her, after remembering her husband, a comrade in struggle who was also imprisoned and had to carry out an internal exile, and to remember the suffering her children went through, she assured that the struggle for human rights and justice is still \"not finished.\" ==Who else?== Voices that break the silence is a sculptural, graphic and audio installation that achieves the unthinkable. The piece can be seen and, fundamentally, heard, as of March 2016 in the courtyard of the Museum of Memory, in Córdoba, Argentina corner Moreno, a place of Memory where the Second Army Corps operated in the last dictatorship.12 The lawyer Olga Cabrera Hansen, the psychologist Marta Bertolino, the worker Teresita Marciani, Susy Solanas and Estela Hernández gave their testimonies in 1984 in the trials of the military juntas. All of them were detained by the military dictatorship. Theirs are only five voices among many others, but they have the double peculiarity of expressing the harsh reality of the forced disappearance of people while it was suffered by women, while arming a referential web where the same names of victims are crossed and victimizers, beginning the clarification of the destinies of the disappeared and the responsibilities of their murderers and torturers. > The crimes they narrate happened a few meters from where we heard them, > almost flush with the tiles, sitting or lying on the floor, with the city > and the trees around.

      "Oscar Espinosa Chepe[SEP]Óscar Manuel Espinosa Chepe (November 29, 1940 – September 23, 2013) was a Cuban economist and dissident. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested, tried and convicted in 2003 as part of a crackdown by the Cuban government nicknamed the \"Black Spring\". He was given a twenty-year sentence on a charge of \"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\", causing Amnesty International to declare him as a prisoner of conscience. ==Background== Espinosa was a graduate of the University of Havana, where he received a degree in economics. He served on Prime Minister Fidel Castro's Economic Advisory Group from 1965 to 1968 before spending fourteen years as the economic adviser at the Cuban embassy in Belgrade, overseeing Cuba's economic and technological cooperation with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. In 1984, he returned to Cuba to work at the National Bank, where he was responsible for trade and tourism. However, throughout the 1980s, Espinosa increasingly disagreed with national economic policy. When he discussed his views with a colleague in 1992, he was demoted, and four years later was fired. Espinosa began to write critiques of Cuban economic policy which he published overseas. He also hosted a radio program titled Charlando con Chepe (\"Chatting with Chepe\") in which he discussed the Cuban economy; the program was carried on the U.S.-funded station Radio Martí. Espinosa was married to independent Cuban journalist Miriam Leiva. ==Arrest and trial== On March 19, 2003, Espinosa was arrested during the Black Spring after security agents reportedly spent 10 hours searching his apartment. At a trial on April 3, 2003, Espinosa was accused of \"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\". Authorities stated that Espinosa had received money from the U.S. government, and that US$13,600 had been discovered sewn into one of his jackets. Espinosa was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested and tried. Following a rejected appeal by Espinosa, the Representative of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Christine Chanet, appealed to President Castro to pardon him. The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush appealed to Castro on Espinosa's behalf, calling on the government to provide treatment for his liver disease. A spokesman described the Cuban government as \"going out of its way\" to be inhumane to its prisoners. Espinosa's wife Leiva reported that he had lost forty pounds since his arrest and was kept in a cell with no windows or running water. Leiva became active in the Ladies in White, a group of wives of political prisoners which marched through Havana each Sunday protesting their husbands' detention. She continued to march even after Espinosa's early release. == Release == Espinosa was released from prison along with fellow writer Raúl Rivero on November 29, 2004, after serving just over 19 months of his prison sentence; It was his sixty-fourth birthday. The authorities granted him medical parole because his already poor health had declined seriously during his incarceration. After his release, he called on the government to release the remaining Black Spring prisoners, stating, \"The government really committed a very big error with us. We are completely peaceful and we want only the reconciliation of Cuban society.\" In 2006, Espinosa stated his opposition to U.S. funding for the Cuban dissident movement, calling it \"counterproductive\" and stating that the Cuban people must solve its own problems. Following Raúl Castro's assumption of the presidency, Espinosa expressed his hope that Castro could be the Deng Xiaoping of Cuba, improving the economy and the standard of living. ==Death== He died of liver disease on September 23, 2013, in Spain. ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Cuba Category:Cuban democracy activists Category:Cuban dissidents Category:Cuban economists Category:Cuban journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:University of Havana alumni Category:Deaths from liver disease Category:Cuban prisoners and detainees\n",

      "Solar eclipse of January 23, 1860[SEP]An annular solar eclipse occurred on January 23, 1860 during summer. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. ==Description== The eclipse was visible in much of the South Island and the southernmost portion of North Island around Wellington in New Zealand, it was also visible in all of Antarctica (much of the areas had a 24-hour daylight), South America's Patagonia and Oceanian islands such as Macquarrie, Chatham, Antipodes, Tahiti and Tuamotu It was part of solar saros 119. On the other side as the Moon from the Earth headed towards the left at New Zealand, as the umbral path was outside the South Pole and over the Prime Meridian to the Peninsula, the Moon from the Earth was seen as it was going on bottom, then on the right and on top in the peninsular portion though the Earth rotates to the east as it was north of the South Pole at the Prime Meridian, the rest of the world saw the Moon from the Earth headed towards the left. The umbral portion was 719 km (449 mi) long and started in Northern Antarctica from east of the Prime Meridian to the 40th meridian east all the way to the west of its peninsula and was shown up to 91% obscuration of the sun. The greatest occurred within the Pacific in Peninsular Antarctica at 71.8 N & 117.2 W at 0:27 UTC (4:27 PM local time on January 22) and lasted for over 6 minutes. The eclipse showed up to 50% obscuration off the coast of Antarctica in the area separating the Indian and the Pacific Oceans. ==Related eclipses== === Saros 119 === It is a part of Saros cycle 119, repeating every 18 years, 11 days, containing 71 events. The series started with partial solar eclipse on May 15, 850 AD. It contains total eclipses on August 9, 994 AD and August 20, 1012 with a hybrid eclipse on August 31, 1030. It has annular eclipses from September 10, 1048 through March 18, 1950. The series ends at member 71 as a partial eclipse on June 24, 2112. The longest duration of totality was only 32 seconds on August 20, 1012. The longest duration of annularity was 7 minutes, 37 seconds on September 1, 1625.

      "April 1969 lunar eclipse[SEP]A penumbral lunar eclipse took place on Wednesday, April 2, 1969, the first of three penumbral lunar eclipses in 1969, the second being on Wednesday, August 27, and the last being on Thursday, September 25. This subtle penumbral eclipse may have been visible to a skilled observer at maximum eclipse. 70.337% of the Moon's disc was partially shaded by the Earth (none of it was in total shadow), which caused a gentle shadow gradient across its disc at maximum; the eclipse as a whole lasted 3 hours, 43 minutes and 46.9 seconds.

      "Solar eclipse of April 19, 2004[SEP]A partial solar eclipse took place on 19 April 2004. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was largely visible over the south Atlantic Ocean and north shores of Antarctica, most prominently the Antarctic Peninsula. The eclipse could also be seen in southern Africa at sunset. Considering the magnitude and the solar altitude, South Africa was the best place to observe this eclipse. In Cape Town, the sun was about 40% obscured, while in Pretoria the sun was 29% obscured. Further north, the eclipse remained visible up to Angola, southern DR Congo and Tanzania. == Images == File:SE2004Apr19P.gif Animated eclipse path ==Related eclipses== === Eclipse season === This is the first eclipse this season.

      "Solar eclipse of December 14, 1955[SEP]An annular solar eclipse occurred on December 14, 1955. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. Annularity was visible from French Equatorial Africa (the part now belonging to Chad), Libya, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (the part now belonging to Sudan) including the capital city Khartoum, French Somaliland (today's Djibouti) including the capital Djibouti City, British Somaliland (today's Somaliland) including the capital city Hargeisa, the Trust Territory of Somaliland (today's Somalia), the Maldives, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Burma, Thailand including the capital city Bangkok, Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam and South Vietnam (now belonging to Vietnam), China, British Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Ryukyu Islands. It was the third central solar eclipse visible from Bangkok from 1948 to 1958, where it is rare for a large city to witness four central solar eclipses in just 9.945 years. This was the 20th member Solar Saros 141, and the last of first set of solar eclipses without a penumbral internal contact (without a penumbra northern limit), the next event is the 1973 Dec 24 event, which is the first of 19 solar eclipses with a penumbral internal contact (has penumbral northern and southern limits) until 2298 Jul 09. Occurring only one day before apogee (December 15, 1955), the Moon's apparent diameter was smaller. The duration of annularity at maximum eclipse (closest to but slightly shorter than the longest duration) was 12 minutes, 9.17 seconds in the Indian Ocean. It was the longest annular solar eclipse from December 17, 168 to January 14, 3080. Among all the 23740 solar eclipses from 4000 BC to 6000 AD, 7881 are annular, and only 3 of them are longer than this one. == More details == Eclipse Magnitude: 0.91764 Eclipse Obscuration: 0.84206 Gamma: 0.42658 Saros Series: 141st (20 of 70) Greatest Eclipse: 14 Dec 1955 07:01:53.7 UTC (07:02:25.1 TD) Ecliptic Conjunction: 14 Dec 1955 07:07:02.4 UTC (07:07:33.8 TD) Equatorial Conjunction: 14 Dec 1955 07:03:46.6 UTC (07:04:18.1 TD) Sun right ascension: 17.38 Moon right ascension: 17.38 Earth's shadow right ascension: 5.38 Sun declination: -23.2 Moon declination: -22.8 Earth's shadow declination: 23.2 Sun diameter: 1949.8 arcseconds Moon diameter: 1765.0 arcseconds Path Width at Greatest Eclipse: 345.7 km (214.8 mi) Path Width at Greatest Duration: 345.8 km (214.9 mi) Central Duration at Greatest Eclipse: 12 minutes, 9.17 seconds Central Duration at Greatest Duration: 12 minutes, 9.23 seconds == Extreme duration == With a maximum length of annularity duration of 12 minutes and 9.17 seconds, this is the longest solar eclipse in the millennium, as well as the longest duration in Saros 141 and one of the longest eclipses ever observed.

The moon's apparent diameter was larger because the eclipse occurred 5.2 days after perigee (Perigee on approximately 1981 Jan 15 at 03:01:56.7 UTC).Hermit Eclipse: Saros cycle 114 This was a relatively rare total penumbral lunar eclipse with the moon passing entirely within the penumbral shadow without entering the darker umbral shadow.Total Penumbral Lunar Eclipses, Jean Meeus, June 1980 == More details about the Penumbral Lunar Eclipse of 1981 Jan 20. == Penumbral Magnitude = 1.01360 Umbral Magnitude = -0.01916 Gamma = -1.01421 Sun Right Ascension = 20.16 Sun Declination = -20.1 Sun Diameter: 1950.4 arc-seconds (32'30.4\") Moon Right Ascension = 8.15 Moon Declination = 19.1 Moon Diameter = 1888.6 arc-seconds (31'28.6\") Earth's Shadow Right Ascension: 8.16 Earth's Shadow Declination: 20.1 Earth's Shadow Diameter: 8,968.32 arc-seconds (2.4912 degrees) Greatest Eclipse: Tuesday, 20 January 1981 at 07:49:56.7 UTC Saros Series = 114th (57 of 71) == Visibility == 320px 320px == Related lunar eclipses == === Eclipses in 1981 === * A penumbral lunar eclipse on Tuesday, 20 January 1981. * An annular solar eclipse on Wednesday, 4 February 1981. * A partial lunar eclipse on Friday, 17 July 1981. * A total solar eclipse on Friday, 31 July 1981. === Lunar year series === ===Saros series=== Lunar Saros series 114, repeating every 18 years and 11 days, has a total of 71 lunar eclipse events including 13 total lunar eclipses.
