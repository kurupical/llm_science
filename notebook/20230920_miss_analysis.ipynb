The shape and symmetry of the sporangia was then used to divide up the group.

      "M. E. Clifton James Monty's Double (released in the US as The Counterfeit General Montgomery). The book became the basis for the script of the 1958 film starring John Mills and Cecil Parker, with James playing himself and Montgomery. The script was \"tweaked\" for effect. \"Operation Copperhead\" became \"Operation Hambone\", and additional elements of comedy, danger and intrigue were added, including a fictional kidnapping attempt by enemy forces. He also appeared in a short cameo role (again non-speaking and uncredited) as Field Marshal Montgomery (using a mix of original postwar footage of Monty inspecting an RAF passing- out parade and close-up shots of James)\n",

Whiskey produced by a pot still increases in strength with each distillation and is typically distilled to about 70% ABV, and column stills are capable of producing much higher proof levels. Most distillers reduce the proof by adding water to the whiskey prior to casking it. The proof level tends to change somewhat during the aging process, depending on storage conditions. Scotch whisky is typically aged in used barrels, and due to the relatively cool climate in Scotland, the proof level typically stays the same or goes down\n",

The level of alcohol-by-volume (ABV) strength for a cask strength whisky or rum is typically in the range of 52–66% ABV. Most bottled whisky and rum is diluted with water to reduce its strength (i.e., ABV level) to a level that makes it less expensive to produce and more palatable to most consumers –\n",

By the mid-1950s, with Walt Disney's attention primarily set on new endeavours such as live-action films, television and the Disneyland theme park, production of the animated films was left primarily in the hands of the \"Nine Old Men\" trust of head animators and directors. This led to several delays in approvals during the production of Sleeping Beauty, which was finally released in 1959. At $6 million, it was Disney's most expensive film to date, produced in a heavily-stylised art style devised by artist Eyvind Earle and presented in large-format Super Technirama 70 with six-track stereophonic\n",

Later, Schumann left the project due to creative differences with Disney, and George Bruns was recommended to replace him by Ward Kimball. Sleeping Beauty was both Bruns' first collaboration with the Disney studio and his first experience as a film composer. Working closely with animators, directors, and story artists, Bruns spent three years studying and experimenting with Tchaikovsky's music to make it work as a film score.\n",

Virokines occupy binding sites on host receptors, thereby inhibiting access by signaling molecules. Viroceptors mimic host receptors and thus divert signaling molecules from finding their targets. Cytokine-binding proteins bind to and sequester cytokines, occluding the binding surface through which they interact with receptors.

Farnesol and its derivatives are important starting compounds for natural and artificial organic synthesis. ==Uses== Farnesol is present in many essential oils such as citronella, neroli, cyclamen, lemon grass, tuberose, rose, musk, balsam, and tolu. It is used in perfumery to emphasize the odors of sweet, floral perfumes. It enhances perfume scent by acting as a co-solvent that regulates the volatility of the odorants. It is especially used in lilac perfumes. Farnesol is a natural pesticide for mites and is a pheromone for several other insects.

The theorem can be proved without any use of Galois theory. Furthermore, the Galois group of a simple antiderivative is either trivial (if no field extension is required to express it), or is simply the additive group of the constants (corresponding to the constant of integration). Thus, an antiderivative's differential Galois group does not encode enough information to determine if it can be expressed using elementary functions, the major condition of Liouville's theorem. ==See also==\n",

With the development of quantum mechanics in the beginning of the 20th century came the concept that mathematical operations could be performed on an entire particle wavefunction. In other words, one could compute functions on multiple states simultaneously. This led to the concept of a quantum computer in the latter half of the 20th century that took off in the 1990s when Peter Shor showed that such methods could be used to factor large numbers in polynomial time, which, if\n",

Technically speaking, most pressure sensors are really differential pressure sensors; for example a gauge pressure sensor is merely a differential pressure sensor in which one side is open to the ambient atmosphere. The zero reference in use is usually implied by context, and these words are added only when clarification is needed. Tire pressure and blood pressure are gauge pressures by convention, while atmospheric pressures, deep vacuum pressures, and altimeter pressures must be absolute. For most working fluids where a fluid exists in a closed system, gauge pressure measurement prevails. Pressure instruments connected to the system will indicate pressures\n",

A very simple version is a U-shaped tube half-full of liquid, one side of which is connected to the region of interest while the reference pressure (which might be the atmospheric pressure or a vacuum) is applied to the other. The difference in liquid levels represents the applied pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of fluid of height h and density ρ is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation, P = hgρ.

A tire pressure gauge is an example of gauge pressure measurement; when it indicates zero, then the pressure it is measuring is the same as the ambient pressure.

About 1880, he started working for the Holyoke Water Power Company in Massachusetts. He remained with the company until 1889.

Some insects, fish, amphibians, mollusks, crustaceans, cnidarians, echinoderms, and tunicates undergo metamorphosis, which is often accompanied by a change of nutrition source or behavior. Animals can be divided into species that undergo complete metamorphosis (\"holometaboly\"), incomplete metamorphosis (\"hemimetaboly\"), or no metamorphosis (\"ametaboly\").

This metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours, and is initiated by production of the hormone thyroxine. This causes different tissues to develop in different ways. The principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch, making the front legs visible.
